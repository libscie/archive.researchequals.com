A reality made of silent contamination, of official data that hide the truth, and of unheard complaints. On this landscape of unspoken or inaccessible information, the people who cultivate the land, breed animals, or simply live there are divided between those who want to discover and denounce, and those who remain silent, captured by the system. 'Story of a civic sentinel' tells the challenges encountered by those who decide to investigate into the contamination, monitor it, and fight for the truth to be known.\nThe novel can be downloaded for free at this link:\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9-M4-Yj7JtbVfY_vrH_AxU46gm2VzEI/view?usp=sharing \n\nThe novel is also available in Spanish and Italian, and these versions can be found on the SensJus page.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":20,"main":{"name":"Story of a civic sentinel.pdf","size":39306947,"uuid":"24ab409c-418d-46a5-abde-b4913d4b9801","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/24ab409c-418d-46a5-abde-b4913d4b9801/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/24ab409c-418d-46a5-abde-b4913d4b9801/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":22,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T22:33:12.990Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-01T22:42:00.450Z","moduleId":23,"workspaceId":69,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":69,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T22:18:24.097Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-01T22:26:19.774Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"sensjus","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/0ff5ff5d-8989-4519-a9f9-1c93b25ff8cd/-/crop/394x395/0,8/-/preview/","firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Berti Suman","name":null,"bio":"Anna Berti Suman is a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow and former Dutch Research Council  Fellow at the European Commission Joint Research Centre.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The SensJus project launched a short graphic novel recounting the story of a civic sentinel, which tells the struggle of many and a lesson of hope.
The story begins in a land, afflicted by oil extraction. A reality made of silent contamination, of official data that hide the truth, and of unheard complaints. On this landscape of unspoken or inaccessible information, the people who cultivate the land, breed animals, or simply live there are divided between those who want to discover and denounce, and those who remain silent, captured by the system. 'Story of a civic sentinel' tells the challenges encountered by those who decide to investigate into the contamination, monitor it, and fight for the truth to be known.
The novel can be downloaded for free at this link:

<p>The novel is also available in Spanish and Italian, and these versions can be found on the SensJus page.</p>

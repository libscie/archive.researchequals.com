Given your expertise in this area, we would like to invite you to participate in this research project. We invite you to join, because you have published on the topic of power and corruption in the last five years. We have sent the same invitation to other researchers who in the last five years have published on power and corruption in the areas of Economy, History, Law, Management, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, or Theology.</p><p id=\"aab2b717-0978-4cea-86c9-553aaff14a88\" class=\"\">Inspired by collaborative research projects like<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747646\"> Many Analysts</a> and<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01973533.2019.1577736\"> Many Labs</a> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000178\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918810225\"> 2</a>,<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.10.012\"> 3</a>,<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vef2c\"> 4</a>), we aim to explore how collaboration among experts from different disciplines yields novel insights (what we are calling <a href=\"https://blog.libscie.org/p/268ab985-d848-4545-bedc-3537566a3c2a/\">Many Paths</a>). We have chosen to focus on the question “Does power corrupt?”, given that it is an age-old question that is still highly relevant today for research as well as practice, and that a comprehensive answer to this question requires pooling insights from various disciplines.</p><p id=\"a397fea7-091b-48a0-8a9f-6adc0af4a588\" class=\"\">You can contribute to the Many Paths project by publishing theoretical perspectives, data (analyses), reflections on others’ contributions, or any other form of communication that would contribute to addressing the research question “Does power corrupt?” In doing so, we hope that we will collectively come to a comprehensive answer and novel insights regarding this question.</p><p id=\"b66ade2e-380d-411b-a024-66fceb8241ea\" class=\"\">We invite researchers interested in participating in this project to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_ZymrIWVBIgMIAoROfEARGiwLL4ssH6GBPzVS62rxbxSsIg/viewform\">fill out this form</a>.

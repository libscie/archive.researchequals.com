*Subject: Multidisciplinary study on “Does power corrupt?”*

Dear `{First_Name}` `{Last_Name}`,

We are gathering a group of researchers from different disciplines to embark on a research project focusing on the question “**Does power corrupt?**”. Given your expertise in this area, we would like to invite you to participate in this research project. We invite you to join, because you have published on the topic of power and corruption in the last five years. We have sent the same invitation to other researchers who in the last five years have published on power and corruption in the areas of Economy, History, Law, Management, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, or Theology.

Inspired by collaborative research projects like [Many Analysts](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747646) and [Many Labs](https://doi.org/10.1080/01973533.2019.1577736) ([1](https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000178), [2](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918810225), [3](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.10.012), [4](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vef2c)), we aim to explore how collaboration among experts from different disciplines yields novel insights (what we are calling [Many Paths](https://blog.libscie.org/p/268ab985-d848-4545-bedc-3537566a3c2a/)). We have chosen to focus on the question “Does power corrupt?”, given that it is an age-old question that is still highly relevant today for research as well as practice, and that a comprehensive answer to this question requires pooling insights from various disciplines.

You can contribute to the Many Paths project by publishing theoretical perspectives, data (analyses), reflections on others’ contributions, or any other form of communication that would contribute to addressing the research question “Does power corrupt?” In doing so, we hope that we will collectively come to a comprehensive answer and novel insights regarding this question.

We invite researchers interested in participating in this project to [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_ZymrIWVBIgMIAoROfEARGiwLL4ssH6GBPzVS62rxbxSsIg/viewform). The deadline for indicating your interest is March 31st. After the deadline, those who signed up will receive further instructions regarding how to proceed.

The project will take place on [Hypergraph](http://hypergraph.xyz), a digital platform specifically designed for facilitating interdisciplinary research discussions.

The project will run from **April 1st 2021 through March 31st 2022**. After that, we will take stock of the outcomes and intend to write two papers:

1. A *content* paper summarizing the insights and conclusions from your collaborative discussion regarding the question “Does power corrupt?”. For this paper we will list everyone who actively participated in the project as a co-author.
2. A *method* paper focusing on the Many Paths method as a way of conducting interdisciplinary, collaborative research. For this paper we will list everyone who actively participated in the project in the acknowledgements.

In terms of what’s in it for you, we offer the following:

- A potential publication in a top-tier interdisciplinary journal.
- Improving your expertise by exchanging knowledge with and learning from experts in other scientific disciplines that focus on the same topic.
- Being on the frontier of the development of a new, collaborative method to conduct research. Specifically, Hypergraph is developed with the help of a [Shuttleworth Grant](https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/chris-hartgerink/) and based on the idea of a new publishing system [outlined here](https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/6/2/21). The Many Paths project is the first attempt to assess the feasibility of Hypergraph in practice.

In case you are interested in participating, we ask the following from you:

1. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_ZymrIWVBIgMIAoROfEARGiwLL4ssH6GBPzVS62rxbxSsIg/viewform) to indicate your interest before March 31st 2021.
2. On April 1st 2021 we will send you more information on the project, including a 90-minute online training module explaining how Hypergraph works. You need to follow this training before May 1st 2021.
3. Contribute to the Many Paths project on “Does power corrupt” from May 1st 2021 until April 30th 2022, which you can do in any of the ways mentioned before.
4. Review and provide suggestions for the *content* paper that we will draft from April 1st 2022 until August 31st 2022.

As indicated, we have specifically selected you to participate in this study based on a search effort focusing on recent publications in the areas of power and corruption. We therefore hope that you will participate.

We can imagine that you have many questions. We hope the Many Paths project description, which [can be found here](https://blog.libscie.org/p/990893a4-8e8c-4ac7-a2c8-5ec6e4b83cb9/), answers most of them. Feel free to ask us anything by contacting us at [manypaths@libscie.org](mailto:manypaths@libscie.org) or by replying to this email.

Best regards,

The Many Paths project team

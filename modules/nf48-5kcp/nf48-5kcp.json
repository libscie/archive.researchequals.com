This research tested variation in the replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36 independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect – imagined contact reducing prejudice – showed weak support for replicability. And two effects – flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification – did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Richard A.","family":"Klein","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}]},{"given":"Kate A.","family":"Ratliff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}]},{"given":"Michelangelo","family":"Vianello","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Padua, Italy"}]},{"given":"Reginald B.","family":"Adams","suffix":"Jr.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"}]},{"given":"Štěpán","family":"Bahník","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Würzburg, Germany"}]},{"given":"Michael J.","family":"Bernstein","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pennsylvania State University Abington, PA, USA"}]},{"given":"Konrad","family":"Bocian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Social Sciences and Humanities Campus Sopot, Poland"}]},{"given":"Mark J.","family":"Brandt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands"}]},{"given":"Beach","family":"Brooks","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}]},{"given":"Claudia Chloe","family":"Brumbaugh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"City University of New York, USA"}]},{"given":"Zeynep","family":"Cemalcilar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Koç University, Istanbul, Turkey"}]},{"given":"Jesse","family":"Chandler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"},{"name":"PRIME Research, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}]},{"given":"Winnee","family":"Cheong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"HELP University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"}]},{"given":"William E.","family":"Davis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"}]},{"given":"Thierry","family":"Devos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"San Diego State University, CA, USA"}]},{"given":"Matthew","family":"Eisner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}]},{"given":"Natalia","family":"Frankowska","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Social Sciences and Humanities Campus Sopot, Poland"}]},{"given":"David","family":"Furrow","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Mount Saint Vincent University, Nova Scotia, Canada"}]},{"given":"Elisa Maria","family":"Galliani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Padua, Italy"}]},{"given":"Fred","family":"Hasselman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands"},{"name":"University Nijmegen, The Netherlands"}]},{"given":"Joshua A.","family":"Hicks","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"}]},{"given":"James F.","family":"Hovermale","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA"}]},{"given":"S.

Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 ( Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"R.","family":"Silberzahn","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Organisational Behaviour, University of Sussex Business School"}]},{"given":"E.

Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance ( p &lt; .05), we found that 15 (54%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion ( p &lt; .0001), 14 (50%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen’s ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small (&lt; 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57%), and 9 effects (32%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Richard A.","family":"Klein","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratoire Inter-universitaire de Psychologie, Personnalité, Cognition, Changement Social (LIP/PC2S), Université Grenoble Alpes"}]},{"given":"Michelangelo","family":"Vianello","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Philosophy, Sociology, Education and Applied Psychology, University of Padua"}]},{"given":"Fred","family":"Hasselman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen"},{"name":"School of Pedagogical and Educational Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen"}]},{"given":"Byron G.","family":"Adams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Social Psychology, Tilburg University"},{"name":"Department of Industrial Psychology and People Management, University of Johannesburg"}]},{"given":"Reginald B.","family":"Adams","suffix":"Jr.","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University"}]},{"given":"Sinan","family":"Alper","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, Yasar University"}]},{"given":"Mark","family":"Aveyard","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of International Studies, American University of Sharjah"}]},{"given":"Jordan R.","family":"Axt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Advanced Hindsight, Duke University"}]},{"given":"Mayowa T.","family":"Babalola","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Business and Economics, United Arab Emirates University"}]},{"given":"Štěpán","family":"Bahník","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Management, Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics, Prague"}]},{"given":"Rishtee","family":"Batra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Erivan K.

Salience Effect With and Without Original Author Involvement","description":"<p>Interpreting a failure to replicate is complicated by the fact that the failure could be due to the original finding being a false positive, unrecognized moderating influences between the original and replication procedures, or faulty implementation of the procedures in the replication. One strategy to maximize replication quality is involving the original authors in study design. We (N = 21 Labs and N = 2,220 participants) experimentally tested whether original author involvement improved replicability of a classic finding from Terror Management Theory (Greenberg et al., 1994). Our results were non-diagnostic of whether original author involvement improves replicability because we were unable to replicate the finding under any conditions. This suggests that the original finding was either a false positive or the conditions necessary to obtain it are not yet understood or no longer exist.

Using a combination of biomolecular detection, paleodietary isotopes, skeletal analysis, and historical records, we aim to identify early adopters, the social context motivating their consumption, and the impact on health among individuals across various social strata. Through multiproxy analysis, and comparing with countries more extensively involved in tobacco trade and cultivation, England and the Netherlands, we will provide a valuable perspective on the introduction of tobacco to Danish society.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":24,"main":{"name":"veni_pre-proposal_form_2025_BPB_v2-unsigned.pdf","size":353246,"uuid":"7441b9c1-a196-4e99-8b46-f97f695f39e6","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/7441b9c1-a196-4e99-8b46-f97f695f39e6/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/7441b9c1-a196-4e99-8b46-f97f695f39e6/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":991,"createdAt":"2025-08-31T12:11:50.480Z","updatedAt":"2025-09-02T18:26:59.358Z","moduleId":1246,"workspaceId":536,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":536,"createdAt":"2024-03-28T18:22:51.228Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-22T12:09:24.786Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"bpbartholdy","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/d2306e65-37e9-4ef5-88e5-19411e98d2c6/-/crop/200x200/0,9/-/preview/","firstName":"Bj√∏rn Peare","lastName":"Bartholdy","name":null,"bio":"Data Steward at TU Delft with a PhD in Archaeological Science from Leiden University","pronouns":"he/him","url":"https://bjorns.website","orcid":"0000-0003-3985-1016"}}],"license":{"id":2,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"CC BY 4.0","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VKT0n4i9hFlz"},"type":{"id":24,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q947859","name":"Research proposal","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

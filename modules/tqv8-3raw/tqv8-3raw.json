In contrast, alternative seafood networks (ASNs) that distribute seafood through local and direct marketing channels were identified as a “bright spot”. In this paper, we draw on multiple lines of quantitative and qualitative evidence to show that ASNs experienced a temporary pandemic “bump” in both the United States and Canada in the wake of supply chain disruptions and government mandated social protections. We use a systemic resilience framework to analyze the factors that enabled ASNs to be resilient during the pandemic as well as challenges. The contrast between ASNs and the broader seafood system during COVID-19 raises important questions about the role that local and regional food systems may play during crises and highlights the need for functional diversity in supply chains.\n\nThis paper was authored by Joshua S Stoll, Hannah L Harrison, Emily De Sousa, Debra Callaway, Melissa Collier, Kelly Harrell, Buck Jones, Jordyn Kastlunger, Emma Kramer, Steve Kurian, M Alan Lovewell, Sonia Strobel, Tracy Sylvester, Brett Tolley, Andrea Tomlinson, Easton R White, Talia Young, Philip A Loring.\n\nThis paper was originally published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":4979,"main":{"name":"Stoll et al.

Summary: Open Science Communities (OSCs) are local, bottom-up initiatives aimed at accelerating the adoption of Open Science practices in academia through peer-to-peer learning. The Dutch network of OSC’s (OSC-NL; www.osc-nl.com) empowers the twelve local OSC’s in the Netherlands and voices their bottom-up perspectives on Open Science to national (policy) stakeholders. This project will accelerate the impact of this community-led network by 1) professionalising the network’s community management through knowledge exchange and training, and 2) creating opportunity, time, and resources for engaging the research community in together shifting norms towards a more open future by organising specific open science events. \nTeam members:\n\nA.E. van 't Veer (Leiden University),\nA.

While pioneering researchers are developing OS practices, the majority sticks to status quo. To transition to common practice, we must engage a critical proportion of the academic community. In this transition, OS Communities (OSCs) play a key role. OSCs are bottom-up learning groups of scholars that discuss OS within and across disciplines. They make OS knowledge more accessible and facilitate communication among scholars and policymakers. Over the past two years, eleven OSCs were founded at several Dutch university cities. In other countries, similar OSCs are starting up. In this article, we discuss the pivotal role OSCs play in the large-scale transition to OS. We emphasize that, despite the grassroot character of OSCs, support from universities is critical for OSCs to be viable, effective, and sustainable.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":377,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8391-8965","given":"Kristijan","family":"Armeni","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Donders

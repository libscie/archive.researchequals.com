<h2>Representative sampling frame</h2>
<p>With the general research question “Does power corrupt?” in mind, we collected a representative sampling frame of researchers in the social sciences and humanities that might be interested in participating in the Many Paths project. We identified these researchers  by conducting a systematic literature search on Web of Science for researchers who have published in the realms of our research question, using the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search**: TOPIC:** (Power AND corrupt*) AND <strong>TITLE:</strong> (Power OR corrupt*) AND Timespan: Custom Range (2015 – 2020)</li>
<li>Refined by <strong>RESEARCH DOMAINS:</strong> (SOCIAL SCIENCES OR ARTS HUMANITIES)</li>
<li>Refined by <strong>DOCUMENT TYPES:</strong> (ARTICLE OR REVIEW OR BOOK OR EARLY ACCESS)</li>
<li>We explained the project goals to two research assistants who subsequently read the titles and abstracts of each article to exclude articles that were not on the topic of interest (disagreements were settled via discussion, if needed).</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of results for each step were: (1) 1,114, (2) 780, (3) 701, and (4) 686 results. For replication purposes, please note that Web of Science was accessed from the University of Zurich that has access to: (1) Web of Science Core Collection, (2) BIOSIS Citation, (3) BIOSIS Previews, (4) Current Contents Connect, (5) Data Citation Index, (6) Derwent Innovations Index, (7) KCI Korean Journal Database, (8) MEDLINE, (9) Russian Science Citation Index, (10) SciELO Citation Index, and (11) Zoological Record</p>
<p>The final sampling frame consisted of 686 articles, of which 486 articles contained contact information for a total of 700 researchers (678 unique), who we subsequently invited to participate in the Many Paths project. The two research assistants extracted the e-mail addresses of the respective corresponding authors. The list of 486 articles is included in the supporting files, but we do not publicly share the emails of the 678 researchers.</p>
<h2>Convenience sample</h2>
<p>We also posted the Many Paths project description <a href="https://blog.libscie.org/p/990893a4-8e8c-4ac7-a2c8-5ec6e4b83cb9/">on the Liberate Science blog</a> as a way to serendipitously attract researchers to the Many Paths project. The project description included an open invitation for people to sign up to participate in the project, an overview of the Many Paths project, a description of the research goals, and the planned timeline.</p>

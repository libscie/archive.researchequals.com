To hedge against this risk of biased omissions, one would need an exhaustive list of major scientific presses and their journals. Such an inclusive catalogue, however, does not exist yet. This paper explores whether webscraping multiple heterogeneous research-related platforms could fill this gap. In a first step, the project draws from the content coverages of Scopus, Publons, DOAJ and SherpaRomeo to extract a preliminary list of publishers that supposedly possess at least 30 journals. In a second step, the project scrapes each of the publisherâ€™s website to fetch their respective journal portfolios. The outcome is a list of 137 publishers comprising 25.816 journals. Many of the publishers, especially those that operate outside the U.S. and Western Europe, would have been overlooked if one had drawn from merely one or two sources. The catalogue can thus be deemed comprehensive, inclusive and diverse. Despite a few limitations (e.g., the non-uniform distribution of the data, or the difficulty of disambiguating publisher names and their imprints), the dataset can serve as a useful basis for large-scale scientometrics analyses investigating the landscape of academic publishers and scholarly journals.</p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":451,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5149-6294","given":"Andreas","family":"Pacher","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]}],"authors":[{"id":147,"createdAt":"2022-03-25T21:50:27.602Z","updatedAt":"2022-03-25T21:53:36.857Z","moduleId":149,"workspaceId":80,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":80,"createdAt":"2022-02-02T11:50:46.501Z","updatedAt":"2022-03-25T21:45:24.614Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"andreas","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=andreas","firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Nishikawa-Pacher","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":"https://twitter.com/andrepacher","orcid":"0000-0001-5149-6294"}}],"license":{"id":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","name":"CC0 Public Domain Dedication","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VJdtMgxTMRvS"},"type":{"id":13,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q42848","name":"Data","schema":"Dataset"},"parents":[],"children":[{"id":181,"createdAt":"2022-06-07T11:34:47.222Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-07T11:34:47.223Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":false,"publishedAt":null,"publishedWhere":null,"originMetadata":"ResearchEquals","url":null,"isbn":null,"prefix":"10.53962","suffix":"vxak-6yyv","title":"Next step of: Journals on Twitter: Predatory Journals","description":"New module based on: Twitter accounts of predatory journals pertaining to the publishers Allied Academies, iMedPub, SCIRP, and SciTechnol (three of them are OMICS-imprints), as of March 2022.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":13,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"type":{"id":13,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q42848","name":"Data","schema":"Dataset"},"authors":[{"id":179,"createdAt":"2022-06-07T11:34:47.222Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-07T11:34:47.223Z","moduleId":181,"workspaceId":18,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":18,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T09:44:17.299Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-01T10:04:19.265Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"daanrutten","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=DaanRutten","firstName":"Daan","lastName":"Rutten","name":null,"bio":"Daan Rutten is the Coordinator of Open Science at Tilburg University.

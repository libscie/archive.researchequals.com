The focus group focused on understanding the barriers researchers encounter that prevent them from adopting alternative publishing methods. \nData information: transcript of the focus group discussion; pictures show the results of in-workshop exercises. \nThe focus group included 2 participants. This transcript is from the workshop held at a generic location in the Netherlands in 2024. The project spanned 3 different locations and one online workshop. Each transcript represents one workshop from each generic location, presented in no particular order. The workshops and focus group discussions are part of the NWO-funded project â€œPublishing Research Output Continuously (PROCess).","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":13,"main":{"name":"Transcript1.docx","size":40335,"uuid":"33ed4670-7ebf-4e23-ac42-28a83a972e7d","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/33ed4670-7ebf-4e23-ac42-28a83a972e7d/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/33ed4670-7ebf-4e23-ac42-28a83a972e7d/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","type":"application","subtype":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}}},"supporting":{"files":[{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/e7bfba83-f975-4a15-b157-7b46c6387054/","size":1619893,"uuid":"e7bfba83-f975-4a15-b157-7b46c6387054","source":null,"is_image":true,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","image_info":{"dpi":[72,72],"width":3024,"format":"HEIF","height":4032,"sequence":false,"color_mode":"RGB","orientation":6,"geo_location":{"latitude":53.22311666666667,"longitude":6.557691666666667},"datetime_original":"2024-05-28T15:54:02"},"datetime_stored":"2024-10-10T16:20:49.492425Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2024-10-10T16:20:49.252278Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/e7bfba83-f975-4a15-b157-7b46c6387054/Location1.jpg","original_filename":"Location1.jpg"}]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":817,"createdAt":"2024-10-08T08:40:54.844Z","updatedAt":"2024-10-10T16:21:41.556Z","moduleId":1072,"workspaceId":520,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":520,"createdAt":"2024-01-16T16:52:20.558Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-22T13:52:48.125Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"jbis","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/8d890dec-1260-4487-8a4f-3b50885f83ce/-/crop/436x436/0,0/-/preview/","firstName":"Januschka","lastName":"Schmidt","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"she/her","url":"https://www.januschkaschmidt.com/about","orcid":null}},{"id":818,"createdAt":"2024-10-08T08:45:42.659Z","updatedAt":"2024-10-21T18:45:40.113Z","moduleId":1072,"workspaceId":120,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":1,"workspace":{"id":120,"createdAt":"2022-02-14T09:47:56.007Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-21T08:49:14.411Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"sarahanne","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/550b14af-f8e5-402b-926c-b228b933bf94/-/crop/2316x2318/0,341/-/preview/","firstName":"Sarahanne","lastName":"Field","name":null,"bio":"I'm a metascientist with a background in quantitative psychology.

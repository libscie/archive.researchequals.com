<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a lightning talk I gave for a JISC led workshop on &quot;Exploring the potential of alternative publishing models&quot; (2023-01-19). This was a closed session, with attendance of pro-vice-chancellors from UK Universities. I presented the ResearchEquals community with the following slides, with the goal of encouraging them to share it with their constituent junior researchers. The target group of the session is policymakers at UK universities, so I wanted to make sure to reach our core target groups (junior researchers, librarians). I again use the new iA Presenter software - you can find the original file as a supporting file in case you'd like to reuse this (unzip it and open it).</p>

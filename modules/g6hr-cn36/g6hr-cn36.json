Summary: Open Science Communities (OSCs) are local, bottom-up initiatives aimed at accelerating the adoption of Open Science practices in academia through peer-to-peer learning. The Dutch network of OSC’s (OSC-NL; www.osc-nl.com) empowers the twelve local OSC’s in the Netherlands and voices their bottom-up perspectives on Open Science to national (policy) stakeholders. This project will accelerate the impact of this community-led network by 1) professionalising the network’s community management through knowledge exchange and training, and 2) creating opportunity, time, and resources for engaging the research community in together shifting norms towards a more open future by organising specific open science events. \nTeam members:\n\nA.E. van 't Veer (Leiden University),\nA.

# **Selection of summaries of some of the collaborative work during Open Science Retreat 2024, the Netherlands (#OSR24NL) & list of contributors of those participants who gave their ORCID for the contributor list.**


  &nbsp; 
*Below you can find summaries of the groupwork that took place at the [Open Science Retreat](https://openscienceretreat.eu/). See [blog](https://openscienceretreat.eu/blog/) for more context surrounding this event hosted by the [Open Science Communities-NL](https://osc-international.com/open-science-community-the-netherlands/). Find more artefacts/outputs from this group of contributors (ORCIDs below) in this [Collection on ResearchEquals](https://www.researchequals.com/collections/mrhg-9r).*

## **Supporting University Change:**
At the Open Science Retreat 2024, the Supporting University Change Group focused on examining popular change management models and their application in preparing organizations for change. They gathered firsthand accounts from the open science community regarding their efforts to influence university leadership agendas. By analyzing these narratives, they identified common motivations, tactics, and governance structures across various universities globally. The group compared and contrasted decision-making processes and influential factors within university leadership landscapes. Ultimately, they consolidated their findings into a written report, synthesizing insights to inform future endeavors in advancing open science initiatives within academic institutions. See [collection](https://www.researchequals.com/collections/mrhg-9r) for the full report.

## **Bridging the gap between Open Science resources and the educators who can benefit from them:**
Many times our data is just AIR instead of FAIR - we create all these amazing resources, but they sit around in some repository and do not actually get reused. One of the most comprehensive collections of teaching material on open science topics is [FORRT](https://forrt.org/). FORRTs [database of curated resources](https://forrt.org/resources/) already comprises a lot of courses and syllabi - and there’s already a lot of metadata we can use! We think it's time to bridge the gap between the abundance of existing Open Science resources and the educators who can benefit from them. Our project aims to make these valuable materials more accessible by highlighting FORRT’s curated syllabi via a social media bot. With that approach, we hope to put these already existing syllabi on the map for those who might not typically delve into databases but are more than happy to explore the Mastodon rabbit hole during their lunch break. Let's empower educators to integrate Open Science practices seamlessly into their teaching by promoting the reuse of existing syllabi and resources: Check out our [bot on Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@FORRT_bot).

## **The Recognition & Rewards / Open Science Assessment group:**
The Recognition & Rewards / Open Science Assessment group has developed a guidance document to encourage and take into account Open Science practices during assessment interviews, such as annual reviews. In order to make the transition to Open Science, it is important that Open Science practices are recognized during assessments. In the document we propose guiding questions to help supervisors to take into account Open Science practices during the assessment. In drafting the document, we took into account various existing efforts on Open Science assessment and annual review documents shared by Open Science retreat participants. We have also included a list of definitions of several Open Science practices to assist supervisors. We will continue to develop the published version by promoting and improving the document in our own local settings and in the Open Science communities! See [collection](https://www.researchequals.com/collections/mrhg-9r) for the full document.


## **[Digital Research Academy](https://digital-research.academy/) Train-the-Trainer in the Netherlands:**
DRA is a network of trainers that give excellent training on digital research skills. In one of the shorter sessions a TTT in the Netherlands was discussed and planned for 21-23 of August. Possible locations are Delft or Utrecht. Mark your calendars and sign up for the [DRA newsletter](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/subscribe/dra) to not miss any updates.

## **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusible) code:**
The Fair Coding group was discussing the slow adoption of FAIR4RS (FAIR for Research Software) coding practices across all fields. To address ease of adoption and trigger policy changes, the group drafted an open letter appealing to publishers and funders to make FAIR4RS required. Furthermore, the group developed an accessible 10-step guide to allow anyone to achieve fairly FAIR code with minimal effort, hoping to encourage adoption in an area that still has the largest gap. See [collection](https://www.researchequals.com/collections/mrhg-9r) for the Fairly FAIR code in 10 steps guide.

## **Measuring Open Science:**

| ||
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Measuring Open Science team collected, reviewed, and analyzed existing research into open science practices. As a team, we developed an interactive overview of open science surveys, which may be used e.g. to reuse questionnaire items on different open science practices. See [dashboard](https://hanneoberman.shinyapps.io/os-surveys/), [repository](https://github.com/oscutrecht/OpenScienceSurveys), [full summary](https://www.researchequals.com/modules/tn38-4q91) and the [collection](https://www.researchequals.com/collections/mrhg-9r) for the Zenodo PID. | ![Screenshot 2024-04-20 at 15.59.50](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1ww9B-W0.png)                                                                               |
 
## **Narrative for sustainable Open Access:**
In the teamwork session that was proposed about ‘Narrative for sustainable Open Access in the Netherlands' we worked on creating a compelling case for not-fo-profit, value-driven models for scholarly communication, that helps (Dutch) decision-makers to steer their future course. There is a growing momentum for changing scholarly publishing away from for-profit and non-inclusive models (e.g., away from gold OA, and towards green or diamond OA), but this is not yet reflected in the current (Dutch) university strategies.

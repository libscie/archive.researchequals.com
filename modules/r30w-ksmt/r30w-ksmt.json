BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Trial design</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Participants</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiânia - Goiás, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded:</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have had fever in the last fifteen days;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are breastfeeding or pregnant;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are younger than 18 years old;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Intervention and comparator</jats:title>\n<jats:p>HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> to 8 x10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Replications of previous scientific work are essential to accumulate knowledge and accelerate scientific progress. Despite their relevance, replication studies are under-used and undercited, leading to a biased view of the literature. To facilitate the uptake of replication studies and their wider use in research, education, and policy, we propose to (1) develop and maintain a comprehensive database cataloguing replication efforts by crowdsourcing contributions; (2) develop two interactive online apps for finding, exploring and visualising replications allowing for
field-specific metascientific analyses; (3) conduct outreach activities to teach how to best engage with our developed resources.</p>

<h2>Shareback from the &quot;Persona non grata&quot; session</h2>
<p>We discussed what <a href="https://superbloom.design/learning/resources/persona-non-grata/">Persona non grata</a> exist for open science infrastructure. They are &quot;people you probably donâ€™t want in your product or service, but who are likely to find their way in anyway.&quot;</p>
<h3>Who</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Airtime sucker&quot; - those who keep claiming lots of attention and energy. For example by continuously going off-topic to the detriment of the project.</li>
<li>Assholes - sometimes one asshole can be enough to spread bad behavior throughout a project, multiplying and infecting the project like a virus</li>
<li>Blind to own bias - those who use the infrastructure to promote their own beliefs, without recognizing that they may be biased. Includes scientific racists, conspiracy theorists, propagandists</li>
<li>Extractionists - those who look to capitalize on the infrastructure by scraping and enclosing the information, essentially hijacking the project</li>
<li>Corruptor - those who abuse power or actively enable unfair mechanisms to proliferate</li>
<li>Overcommitted volunteers - you can't fire volunteers, and volunteers that overpromise and underdeliver can obstruct a project's progress.</li>
<li>Saboteur - those who exploit infrastructure to exclude and undermine colleagues (e.g., actively choosing to use GitHub to exclude people who don't know how to use it, when)</li>
<li>Stalkers - abuse the infrastructure to harass and gather information on their target</li>
<li>Trolls - those who use the infrastructure for unintended, destructive fun (e.g., zoombombing, &quot;Wikipedia graffiti&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Code of conduct is a great reactive mechanism in general to deal with these behaviors</li>
<li>Proactive mechanisms can be tailored to each anti-persona</li>
<li>These proactive mechanisms must take individual's context into account - some leeway for redemption (there might be a misunderstanding)</li>
<li>Design a &quot;polite disqualification&quot; model for the proactive mechanisms</li>
</ul>

## Shareback from the "Persona non grata" session

We discussed what [Persona non grata](https://superbloom.design/learning/resources/persona-non-grata/) exist for open science infrastructure. They are "people you probably donâ€™t want in your product or service, but who are likely to find their way in anyway."

### Who

- "Airtime sucker" - those who keep claiming lots of attention and energy. For example by continuously going off-topic to the detriment of the project.
- Assholes - sometimes one asshole can be enough to spread bad behavior throughout a project, multiplying and infecting the project like a virus
- Blind to own bias - those who use the infrastructure to promote their own beliefs, without recognizing that they may be biased. Includes scientific racists, conspiracy theorists, propagandists
- Extractionists - those who look to capitalize on the infrastructure by scraping and enclosing the information, essentially hijacking the project
- Corruptor - those who abuse power or actively enable unfair mechanisms to proliferate
- Overcommitted volunteers - you can't fire volunteers, and volunteers that overpromise and underdeliver can obstruct a project's progress. 
- Saboteur - those who exploit infrastructure to exclude and undermine colleagues (e.g., actively choosing to use GitHub to exclude people who don't know how to use it, when)
- Stalkers - abuse the infrastructure to harass and gather information on their target
- Trolls - those who use the infrastructure for unintended, destructive fun (e.g., zoombombing, "Wikipedia graffiti") 

### What to do

- Code of conduct is a great reactive mechanism in general to deal with these behaviors
- Proactive mechanisms can be tailored to each anti-persona
- These proactive mechanisms must take individual's context into account - some leeway for redemption (there might be a misunderstanding)
- Design a "polite disqualification" model for the proactive mechanisms

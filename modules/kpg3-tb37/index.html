<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This module contains reproducible code for creating a figure. The figure itself is contained in the supporting files. This figure displays some of the data published in the previous step, as it pertains to the emissions reported by the five biggest publishing houses. This code is written in R and can be run on its own, as long as you have the relevant packages installed and an internet connection is present to download the data.</p>

To do that, the interventions (or conditions) to be compared need to be defined precisely. Hernan and Robins call this \"consistency\" of the counterfactual outcomes. The comparison of some (new) treatment to 'Usual Care' can be problematic if  'Usual Care' is ill-defined, as is often the case. The US PCORI institute has formulated requirements for justification and description of Usual Care. This blog post text addresses this issue and the inspirations that various fields of science took from Isaac Newton.","language":"nl","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":27,"main":{"name":"250616_Gebruikelijke zorg-juni 2025-versie 2.pdf","size":73772,"uuid":"cb05e46b-7438-436a-bc1e-7d7be902d78b","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/cb05e46b-7438-436a-bc1e-7d7be902d78b/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/cb05e46b-7438-436a-bc1e-7d7be902d78b/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":971,"createdAt":"2025-06-18T14:46:06.010Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-18T14:46:27.938Z","moduleId":1213,"workspaceId":146,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":146,"createdAt":"2022-03-13T19:58:59.360Z","updatedAt":"2024-10-04T10:43:33.487Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"grietter","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/35d93b72-5eb1-44a7-b98b-9ab7f8e7ef86/-/crop/450x451/0,6/-/preview/","firstName":"Gerben","lastName":"ter Riet","name":null,"bio":"Senior scientific adviser at the Faculty of Health, Sport & Exercise of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Urban Vitality Centre of Expertise) and associate professor of epidemiology at the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Dept.

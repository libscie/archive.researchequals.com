<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This talk (held on 23 Sep 2024 at Univ Amsterdam, NL) I did on a symposium on Scientific Integrity (and Misconduct) that kicked off the National Open Science Week.
On 6 Sep 2023, an article appeared in NRC Handelsblad on individuals who influenced the Dutch debate on the nitrogen crisis, mainly caused by the unsustainable ways in which The Netherlands do agriculture. Surprisingly, these individuals had links to circles in the USA that have been described in the 2010 book 'Merchants of Doubt'. My talk explores the role of Big Corporate in biomedical science and illustrates the financial power we are up against if we want to oppose their influence on science and policy. A key part in the talk rests on the paper 'The Science for Profit Modelâ€”How and why corporations influence science and the use of science in policy and practice' by Tess Legg et al.</p>

This essay explores its integration into established science through quantum consciousness theories and cosmological models, and into engineering via technologies like cryonics and mind uploading. Drawing on theories such as Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) and the Omega Point, it argues that apotheosis can be reframed as a natural outcome of physical laws and technological advancement. Challenges, including empirical verification and ethical implications, are discussed. Ultimately, this integration could redefine human mortality and existence.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":8,"main":{"name":"integrating-universal-posthumous-apotheosis-into-established-science-and-engineering.pdf","size":125011,"uuid":"859db256-dd63-493c-be0a-17116ec4ef34","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/859db256-dd63-493c-be0a-17116ec4ef34/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/859db256-dd63-493c-be0a-17116ec4ef34/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":1048,"createdAt":"2025-11-23T16:50:14.765Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T16:50:47.915Z","moduleId":1327,"workspaceId":743,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":743,"createdAt":"2025-11-23T05:32:27.138Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T17:07:38.432Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"crcguy","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=CRCguy","firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Ohnemus","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"He/him","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Minister-Alexander-Ohnemus","orcid":null}}],"license":{"id":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","name":"CC0 Public Domain Dedication","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VJdtMgxTMRvS"},"type":{"id":8,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q94535766","name":"Assertion","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

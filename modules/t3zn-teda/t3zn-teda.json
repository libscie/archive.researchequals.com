Sharing our experiences from our work in Open Science and other activist contexts, we identified how promoting Open Science can be frustrating and lead to \"activist burnout\". We designed a Zine that illustrates a meerkat's journey through Open Science advocacy as many of us have experienced it. Zines have been a classic medium for distributing political activism information - free to copy and share and expand. We want to highlight how Open Science - like all political work - is inherently a communal effort and that we need to support each other if we want to make a change. Send the Zine to your students, print it out for your next conference, make your own! \nCopy, print, share, translate! \n\nWork in progress: make a version that is easily editable to facilitate translation into different languages. \n\nFind the link to the READING LIST that inspired this work: \nhttps://www.zotero.org/groups/5952050/os_political_activism_labour_and_advocacy/library\n\nWant to get in touch?

My primary research interest concerns how individuals and groups respond to societal crises, such as the climate and ecological emergency. I explore how our group identities can both help and hinder societal transformations, and why some groups act in more prosocial and proenvironmental ways than others. I also explore how morality and ethics might influence group interactions and societal transformations. \n\nI am also interested in how organisations, policy makers and activists can help to promote societal change towards more sustainable futures. I have worked with a number of governmental and non-governmental organisations, including: the Scottish Government, Northern Ireland Government, the British Standards Institution, Nottingham City Council and BaNES Council. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and bridge the gap between academia, organisations and the public. \n\nI work in an interdisciplinary and mixed methods manner, utilising perspectives from the environmental social sciences (including psychology, sociology, geography, marketing and politics) broadly. I also have a wide interest in methodological innovations and open science, particularly with regards to advances in qualitative methods. I am currently the deputy director of the Centre for Qualitative Research at Bath.

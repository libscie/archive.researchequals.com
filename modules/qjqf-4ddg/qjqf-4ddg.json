These roles are critical for ensuring the reproducibility, transparency, and long-term accessibility of scientific results - particularly in complex, data-intensive fields. However, despite their importance, reproducible research outputs and digital contributions are still not recognized as equivalent to traditional scholarly publications within current academic evaluation systems.\n\nAt the Open Science Retreat 2025 (#OSR25CH), experts from all these fields came together to discuss this systemic gap.  The outcomes of these interdisciplinary discussions are published here.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":17,"main":{"name":"OSRCH25_empowering-new-digital-roles-in-research.pptx","size":272089,"uuid":"7c5fd6bf-89cc-4db1-876b-3f626d73aef6","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/7c5fd6bf-89cc-4db1-876b-3f626d73aef6/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/7c5fd6bf-89cc-4db1-876b-3f626d73aef6/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation","type":"application","subtype":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[{"id":890,"createdAt":"2023-08-28T08:25:05.411Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-28T08:35:42.896Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-08-28T08:35:42.000Z","publishedWhere":"ResearchEquals","originMetadata":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://doi.org/10.53962/jjjx-3xqe","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.53962","suffix":"jjjx-3xqe","title":"Published article: A Manifesto for Rewarding and Recognizing Team Infrastructure Roles","description":"Full version of the published article can be found: https://doi.org/10.36850/mr8\n\n","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":17,"main":{"name":"TIR-Manifesto-published-p1.pdf","size":119849,"uuid":"2f1992bd-c996-43e9-85e7-f9abe61ba56e","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/2f1992bd-c996-43e9-85e7-f9abe61ba56e/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/2f1992bd-c996-43e9-85e7-f9abe61ba56e/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[{"id":646,"createdAt":"2023-08-28T08:25:05.411Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-28T08:34:05.982Z","moduleId":890,"workspaceId":172,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":172,"createdAt":"2022-06-04T17:56:23.286Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-27T10:26:52.533Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"estherplomp","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/97bfd978-26ec-46dc-a61e-6e94ea06b0e4/-/crop/510x510/0,25/-/preview/","firstName":"Esther","lastName":"Plomp","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"she/hers","url":"https://estherplomp.github.io/","orcid":"0000-0003-3625-1357"}}]}],"authors":[{"id":922,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T14:52:31.934Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T15:04:57.535Z","moduleId":1132,"workspaceId":662,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":662,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T10:43:48.706Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T15:08:09.602Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"lydiariedl","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/b508e255-29a1-4bf1-a38c-231dd82893d4/-/crop/443x443/0,11/-/preview/","firstName":"Lydia","lastName":"Riedl","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":null,"orcid":"0000-0003-4131-7891"}}],"license":{"id":2,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"CC BY 4.0","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VKT0n4i9hFlz"},"type":{"id":17,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q17104930","name":"Outcome","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

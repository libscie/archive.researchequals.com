of Nature in all its facets. Not the journal and, yes, with a capital N. Skeptic. Particularly about considering humans and their endeavors as disconnected/superior/inferior from/to Nature. I don't think we are scientists studying Nature, but rather Nature studying itself (changes some perspectives). I don't think we need to conserve biodiversity (as if it was an external object) but we are biodiversity striving to conserve itself (although it often doesn't looks like it). Still don't have a clear definition of the ambiguous term Natural Product. Fascinated by historical, contemporary and future means deployed by humans to learn about his cohabitants on the branches of the tree of Life (particularly non-mammals). Fascinated by the analog/digital facets of Nature. See this interesting post by Freeman Dyson https://www.edge.org/conversation/freeman_dyson-is-life-analog-or-digital. Interested in exploring the potentialities of digital tools for the understanding of Nature. Drafting stuff.

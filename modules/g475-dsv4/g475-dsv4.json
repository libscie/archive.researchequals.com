This would be an important book at any time, but it is essential reading at the present moment when incivility, cruelty, and a distinct lack of empathy seem to be the political and cultural norms.  Eric’s ideas about difficult and critical empathy will resonate with fellow action researchers and provide us with new tools to deepen our abilities to reflect on our own relationships with others and on how we seek to promote positive change in the world around us.  \nPlease check out his book, Difficult Empathy, Education, and the Work of Social Change and please read the full interview in the Educational Action Research Journal\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/journals/reac20 \n\nBy Eric Leake, Mary Brydon-Miller, and Dusty Columbia \n","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":4979,"main":{"name":"Copy of Difficult_Empathy_Pubcast (1).mp3","size":34414164,"uuid":"06ee54af-d4d8-4c01-96fe-011f82022c3f","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/06ee54af-d4d8-4c01-96fe-011f82022c3f/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"audio/mpeg","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/06ee54af-d4d8-4c01-96fe-011f82022c3f/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"video/mp4","type":"video","subtype":"mp4"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":1062,"createdAt":"2026-01-19T22:31:15.508Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-19T22:31:38.759Z","moduleId":1344,"workspaceId":632,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":632,"createdAt":"2025-02-11T14:24:40.538Z","updatedAt":"2025-02-11T15:08:11.083Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"ear","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/a3d475b2-9ecb-4363-bef6-685bb38327a5/-/crop/188x188/0,0/-/preview/","firstName":"Educational Action Research","lastName":"Journal","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/reac20","orcid":null}}],"license":{"id":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","name":"CC0 Public Domain Dedication","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VJdtMgxTMRvS"},"type":{"id":4979,"createdAt":"2023-02-20T19:36:40.966Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q7257257","name":"Pubcast","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We submitted this proposal in the short proposal round for the Connecting Research and Society (COESO) open call on &quot;Citizen Science projects in Social Sciences and Humanities.&quot; We outline a citizen science project which provides accessible legal aid for environmental citizen science communities. To that end, we will implement an “Ask a legal question” tool, to bring together citizen scientists and legal experts. Resulting questions and answers will be published on the open access publishing platform ResearchEquals.com, authored jointly by civic actors and legal experts. This knowledge will be useful for legal experts to refine their knowledge of citizen science and explore possible applications in their legal practice, along with advancing legal research.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In recent years, search bots have gained popularity for their ability to efficiently access and process large volumes of information. This study aims to evaluate the potential of search bots, specifically in R programming language, for theoretical research in quantum technologies. Two research questions are addressed, and two corresponding hypotheses are tested to develop a novel theory in the field of quantum technologies. The results demonstrate the efficacy and potential of search bots as a valuable tool for researchers and scientists working in this rapidly evolving domain.</p>

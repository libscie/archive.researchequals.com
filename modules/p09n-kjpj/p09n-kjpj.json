This study aims to evaluate the potential of search bots, specifically in R programming language, for theoretical research in quantum technologies. Two research questions are addressed, and two corresponding hypotheses are tested to develop a novel theory in the field of quantum technologies. The results demonstrate the efficacy and potential of search bots as a valuable tool for researchers and scientists working in this rapidly evolving domain.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":19,"main":{"name":"Evaluating the Potential of Search Bots for Empirical Research of Quantum Technologies.docx","size":26061,"uuid":"66c6a82f-184b-4b43-83eb-889279af1ee2","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/66c6a82f-184b-4b43-83eb-889279af1ee2/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/66c6a82f-184b-4b43-83eb-889279af1ee2/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","type":"application","subtype":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":499,"createdAt":"2023-03-26T22:11:47.393Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-26T22:14:16.437Z","moduleId":667,"workspaceId":359,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":359,"createdAt":"2023-03-26T16:49:04.736Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-26T21:21:56.300Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"aj_perri","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=aj_perri","firstName":"Karriem","lastName":"Perry","name":null,"bio":"Research scientist in the areas of relational-machine learning, quantum machine learning, quantum Bayesianism, relational quantum mechanics.","pronouns":"he/him","url":"https://github.com/AJ-Perry","orcid":"0000-0002-9992-6027"}}],"license":{"id":2,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"CC BY 4.0","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VKT0n4i9hFlz"},"type":{"id":19,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q333291","name":"Abstract","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

The PANNE group focuses on publication bias analysis, and in this presentation I discussed how the (in)visibility of research work can expand our notion of publication bias.

However, we lack direct evidence that nondisclosure of LGBTQA identity affects worker productivity. In two surveys of LGBTQA-identified scientists, we found that those who did not disclose LGBTQA identities in professional settings authored fewer peer-reviewed publications—a concrete productivity cost. In the second survey, which included straight and cisgender participants as a comparison group, we found that LGBTQA participants who disclosed their sexual orientation had publication counts more like non-LGBTQA participants than those who did not disclose, and that all three groups had similar time since first publication given their academic career stage. These results are most consistent with a productivity cost to nondisclosure of LGBTQA identity in professional settings, and suggest a concrete need to improve scientific workplace climates for sexual and gender minorities.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":49,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0543-3564","given":"Joey","family":"Nelson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Allison","family":"Mattheis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5630-0921","given":"Jeremy B.","family":"Yoder","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1080/00918369.2015.1078632","key":"pone.0263728.ref001","year":"2016","author":"JB Yoder","volume":"63","first-page":"1","article-title":"Queer in STEM: Workplace experiences reported in a national survey of LGBTQA individuals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers","journal-title":"J Homosex","doi-asserted-by":"crossref"},{"key":"pone.0263728.ref002","year":"2017","author":"B Barres","article-title":"Coming out: The experience of LGBT+ people in STEM","journal-title":"Genome Biology"},{"DOI":"10.1300/J082v07n02_06","key":"pone.0263728.ref003","year":"1982","author":"E.

In addition to consideringthe selective publication of results, I argue that we need to also consider the selective publicationof epistemic by-products—observations and knowledge that scientists accumulate incidentallyin the process of carrying out their work. There are three reasons why we should be concernedabout the exclusion of epistemic by-products from the published literature: first, because theyplay an important role in robust replication attempts; second, because their absence can resultin misplaced scientific certainty; and third, because they contribute to a holistic understandingof natural phenomena. However, identifying and addressing publication bias against epistemicby-products and other undervalued forms of knowledge is more difficult than identifying biasagainst quantitative findings. I argue that scientific pluralism and making data publicly accessibleare two potential remedies for addressing this form of publication bias.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":377,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9492-9766","given":"Nicole","family":"Nelson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Wisconsin–Madison"}],"authenticated-orcid":false}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.05.005","key":"ref0","unstructured":"Apfelbach, R., Blanchard, C.

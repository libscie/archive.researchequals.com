NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> and in the first imaging of a black hole<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":381,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Charles R.","family":"Harris","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5263-5070","given":"K.

Quantitative and qualitative data from the social and natural sciences suggest that publication credit is not always accorded on the basis of universalistic principles. It was also found that females may have fewer opportunities in collaborative research to contribute to the same extent as do males and that when they do, they are frequently excluded from authorship. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Alan G.","family":"Heffner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":354,"createdAt":"2022-09-30T17:18:09.200Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-30T17:18:09.200Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2015-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"Learned Publishing","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.1087/20150211","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.1087","suffix":"20150211","title":"Beyond authorship: attribution, contribution, collaboration, and credit","description":null,"language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Amy","family":"Brand","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Liz","family":"Allen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Micah","family":"Altman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Marjorie","family":"Hlava","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jo","family":"Scott","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":356,"createdAt":"2022-09-30T17:18:48.985Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-30T17:18:48.986Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"Nature","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00150-2","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.1038","suffix":"d41586-022-00150-2","title":"Build up big-team science","description":null,"language":"en","licenseId":196,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Nicholas A.","family":"Coles","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"J.

Yet philosophical issues that arise in this context have received little direct attention. The chapter examines several difficulties inherent in establishing authorship in the context of collaborative research. Using case studies, the chapter considers collaborative research that relies on multiple authors, collaborative research with a single author and many collaborators, and radically collaborative research that is distributed widely over disciplinary expertise, time, and space. The chapter argues that the first two types of collaborative research leave a standard understanding of authorship untouched, while the third yields a novel class of significant challenges for our common understanding of authorship.</p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":1335,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Bryce","family":"Huebner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rebecca","family":"Kukla","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eric","family":"Winsberg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":365,"createdAt":"2022-09-30T17:21:03.340Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-30T17:21:03.341Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"SSRN Electronic Journal","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4190976","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.2139","suffix":"ssrn.4190976","title":"Nobel and Novice: Author Prominence Affects Peer Review","description":null,"language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Juergen","family":"Huber","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sabiou","family":"M.

Abstract: The realisation of open science requires diversification of the academic workforce, not only in the transitional period, but also for the maintenance of new infrastructure and behaviours. This brings a welcome opportunity to expand the breadth of roles in academia, with a growth in the range of career paths which can be determined to be “successful” according to an individual's own criteria. Importantly, this will increase the opportunities for skills and ambition to be cultivated in directions which fall outside of the traditional PI track. In this talk, I will describe my own rewarding journey into Research Support, how this has reinvigorated my passion for research, my desire to develop others, and enumerate opportunities for growth and development. The dark side of this move, however, is a deep recognition of how far we have to go, and how much further/quicker/more effectively we could progress with greater resources. This talk is a call to arms: Join me in applying pressure to your intuitions to support your ambition to contribute to research in a way that maximises your skill, authority, and expertise, and puts you to best use in realising their vision for an open academic culture.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":21,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"name":"Gould van Praag, Cassandra","givenName":"Cassandra","familyName":"Gould van Praag","affiliation":["University of Oxford"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":"https://orcid.org","nameIdentifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8584-4637","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]}]},"referencesRaw":[false],"authors":[]},{"id":355,"createdAt":"2022-09-30T17:18:32.516Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-30T17:18:32.517Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2015-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"Nature","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2015.17567","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.1038","suffix":"nature.2015.17567","title":"Physics paper sets record with more than 5,000 authors","description":null,"language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Davide","family":"Castelvecchi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.191803","key":"BFnature201517567_CR1","year":"2015","author":"G Aad","volume":"114","first-page":"191803","unstructured":"Aad, G. et al.

This creates a conflict between what is best for scientists’ careers and what is best for science. In this paper, we show how principles from the theory of multilevel selection provide a toolkit for modifying incentives to better align individual and collective interests. A core principle is the need to shift the level at which selection operates, from individuals to the groups in which individuals are embedded. This principle is used in several fields to improve collective outcomes, including animal husbandry, professional sports, and professional organizations. Shifting the level of selection has the potential to ameliorate several problems in contemporary science, including accounting for scientists’ indirect contributions, reducing individual-level competition, and promoting specialization. We discuss the difficulties associated with changing the level of selection and outline directions for future development in this domain.</p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":451,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7333-0383","given":"Leonid","family":"Tiokhin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Karthik","family":"Panchanathan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7133-5620","given":"Paul E.","family":"Smaldino","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0247-239X","given":"Daniel","family":"Lakens","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":357,"createdAt":"2022-09-30T17:19:06.358Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-30T17:19:06.359Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2020-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"Center for Open Science","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/2mdxh","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.31234","suffix":"osf.io/2mdxh","title":"The Benefits, Barriers, and Risks of Big Team Science","description":"<p>Progress in psychology has been frustrated by challenges concerning replicability, generalizability, strategy selection, inferential reproducibility, and computational reproducibility. Although often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: insufficient investment of intellectual and non-intellectual resources into the typical psychology study. We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big team science can help address these challenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount available for a single study. However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in academic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo Principal Investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to sustainable big team science. We also anticipate that big team science carries unique risks, such as the potential for big team science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, become overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale. Big team science organizations must also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles, raising risks related to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability. If researchers can manage its unique barriers and risks, big team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology and beyond.</p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":451,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7763-3565","given":"Patrick S.","family":"Forscher","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1596-1034","given":"Eric-Jan","family":"Wagenmakers","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Nicholas Alvaro","family":"Coles","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7480-3661","given":"Miguel Alejandro A.","family":"Silan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0766-0795","given":"Natalia Bezerra","family":"Dutra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Dana","family":"Basnight-Brown","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hans","family":"IJzerman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":377,"createdAt":"2022-09-30T17:23:47.898Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-30T17:23:47.899Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"The Journal of Philosophy","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.5840/jphil201811511","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.5840","suffix":"jphil201811511","title":"The Credit Economy and the Economic Rationality of Science","description":null,"language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Kevin J.

A systematic review","description":"<ns4:p><ns4:bold>Background</ns4:bold>: “Open peer review” (OPR), despite being a major pillar of Open Science, has neither a standardized definition nor an agreed schema of its features and implementations. The literature reflects this, with numerous overlapping and contradictory definitions. While for some the term refers to peer review where the identities of both author and reviewer are disclosed to each other, for others it signifies systems where reviewer reports are published alongside articles. For others it signifies both of these conditions, and for yet others it describes systems where not only “invited experts” are able to comment. For still others, it includes a variety of combinations of these and other novel methods.</ns4:p><ns4:p> <ns4:bold>Methods</ns4:bold>: Recognising the absence of a consensus view on what open peer review is, this article undertakes a systematic review of definitions of “open peer review” or “open review”, to create a corpus of 122 definitions. These definitions are systematically analysed to build a coherent typology of the various innovations in peer review signified by the term, and hence provide the precise technical definition currently lacking.</ns4:p><ns4:p> <ns4:bold>Results</ns4:bold>: This quantifiable data yields rich information on the range and extent of differing definitions over time and by broad subject area. Quantifying definitions in this way allows us to accurately portray exactly how ambiguously the phrase “open peer review” has been used thus far, for the literature offers 22 distinct configurations of seven traits, effectively meaning that there are 22 different definitions of OPR in the literature reviewed.</ns4:p><ns4:p> <ns4:bold>Conclusions</ns4:bold>: I propose a pragmatic definition of open peer review as an umbrella term for a number of overlapping ways that peer review models can be adapted in line with the aims of Open Science, including making reviewer and author identities open, publishing review reports and enabling greater participation in the peer review process.</ns4:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4470-7027","given":"Tony","family":"Ross-Hellauer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":false}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1017/s0140525x00011201","key":"ref-1","year":"1982","author":"J Armstrong","volume":"5","first-page":"197","article-title":"Barriers to Scientific Contributions: The Authors Formula.","journal-title":"Behav Brain Sci.

Not the journal and, yes, with a capital N. Skeptic. Particularly about considering humans and their endeavors as disconnected/superior/inferior from/to Nature. I don't think we are scientists studying Nature, but rather Nature studying itself (changes some perspectives). I don't think we need to conserve biodiversity (as if it was an external object) but we are biodiversity striving to conserve itself (although it often doesn't looks like it). Still don't have a clear definition of the ambiguous term Natural Product. Fascinated by historical, contemporary and future means deployed by humans to learn about his cohabitants on the branches of the tree of Life (particularly non-mammals).

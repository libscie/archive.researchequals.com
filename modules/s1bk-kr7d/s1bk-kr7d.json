The comparison itself follows different perspectives (maintaining a historical, typological, or areal viewpoint). In this scientific practice course, we will take a closer look at basic theories and methods which are relevant for the discipline of Multilingual Computational Linguistics. We will look at large corpora with multiple languages of the world as well as data from individual languages and language families.

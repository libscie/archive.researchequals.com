<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>While the discipline of computational linguistics mostly deals with the modeling and the investigation of individual languages (often &quot;big&quot; languages such as English, German, Arabic, or Chinese), Multilingual Computational Linguistics focuses on the comparison of languages, trying to develop new methods and techniques by which languages can be compared automatically or in a computer-assisted manner. The comparison itself follows different perspectives (maintaining a historical, typological, or areal viewpoint). In this scientific practice course, we will take a closer look at basic theories and methods which are relevant for the discipline of Multilingual Computational Linguistics. We will look at large corpora with multiple languages of the world as well as data from individual languages and language families.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Public Dataset for Open Post Academicsâ€™ Leaving the Academy project.</p>
<p>In the public dataset we have omitted the entire response for any respondent who shared specific personal information even if they consented to the use of their data.
This means that the public dataset has an n=190.</p>
<p>We have also omitted several questions that would indicate specific individuals more readily including specific discipline, indications of the dimensions of underrepresentation, and what the respondent does now.
We encourage anyone wishing to look at the full dataset to contact the lead authors, Beth M. Duckles and Borhane Blili-Hamelin.</p>

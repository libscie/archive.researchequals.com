<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Up to 50% of Dutch youth (aged 16-30) experience psychological problems such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, and suicide is the leading cause of death among Dutch youth. In this longitudinal experience sampling study, we will investigate to what extent risk factors and protective factors for psychological problems can be derived from photos shared on social media. We will apply scraping techniques and Machine Learning to extract facial expressions from photos - as well as relevant contextual factors (e.g., being with friends) - and test whether these factors can be used to predict youthâ€™s resilience or vulnerability to psychological problems.</p>

In order to facilitate a rapidly changing research ecosystem, ResearchEquals allows researchers to publish whatever outputs their work creates, instead of working to create outputs that can be published.

I presented the ResearchEquals community with the following slides, with the goal of encouraging them to share it with their constituent junior researchers. The target group of the session is policymakers at UK universities, so I wanted to make sure to reach our core target groups (junior researchers, librarians).

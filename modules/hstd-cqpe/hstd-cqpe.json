These URLs are collected from the public API and can be used to easily download datasets that have previously been shared. The module provides links to 69,214 open datasets hosted on the OSF, in the timeframe 2022-01-01 through 2022-06-31. These URLs can be used to directly download the datasets - please note that some links may break in the future and that if you use this you will need to account for no longer available files.

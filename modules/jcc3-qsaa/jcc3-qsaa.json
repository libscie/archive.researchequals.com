Drives are the neural mechanisms giving rise to motivated behaviours, and should involve a switching mechanism producing motivational transitions which enhance survival and fitness. Lack of drive switching can lead to inflexible, repetitive behaviours, which are a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders, like obsessive compulsive disorder. In order to study drive switching, it would be helpful to directly measure motivational switching in genetically tractable rodent model systems. Here, a potentially useful motivational switching metric for rodent work is described and contrasted to similar concepts in the literature. It is proposed that this ethologically-grounded parameter could be a phenotypic unit relevant to behavioural compulsions in humans.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":1,"main":{"name":"idea 2 drive switching.docx","size":258163,"uuid":"22044fe5-fdd1-4fc2-92e2-87c81603f652","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/22044fe5-fdd1-4fc2-92e2-87c81603f652/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/22044fe5-fdd1-4fc2-92e2-87c81603f652/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","type":"application","subtype":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":334,"createdAt":"2022-11-17T19:13:49.012Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-09T13:17:28.639Z","moduleId":431,"workspaceId":7,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":7,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T09:22:31.096Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-10T13:09:35.003Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"maheshkarnani","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/5f36c8bd-7dc3-4857-8273-19a032f94a13/-/crop/268x268/0,36/-/preview/","firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Karnani","name":null,"bio":"Assistant Prof and group leader at VU CNCR Amsterdam.

Inflexible repetitive motivated behaviours are a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders such as anorexia nervosa and obsessive compulsive disorder. However, studies of motivated behaviours, such as feeding, drinking and socializing, seldom focus on switching between them or the underlying neural mechanisms, termed drives. In this study, we establish a behavioural assay of motivational switching in mice, using a new automated behavioural monitoring device, the Switchmaze. Motivation switching is measured as the ratio of single probe entries to continuous exploitation runs. Transition analysis is used to further dissect altered motivation switching. To study the neural underpinnings of motivation switching, we present a proof-of-concept experiment using chemogenetic inhibition of the prefrontal-hypothalamic axis. This increased the rate of motivation switching, highlighting the involvement of this pathway in drive switching.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":1331,"main":{"name":"automated, ongoing measurement of motivation and drive switching in mice.pdf","size":1458276,"uuid":"ab5799cd-e461-4f3f-a35b-41ba375f209c","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/ab5799cd-e461-4f3f-a35b-41ba375f209c/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/ab5799cd-e461-4f3f-a35b-41ba375f209c/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/36030332-8e4c-4da1-9918-4b43d2affc96/","size":1674369,"uuid":"36030332-8e4c-4da1-9918-4b43d2affc96","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2023-07-13T13:12:16.016902Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2023-07-13T13:12:15.853763Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/36030332-8e4c-4da1-9918-4b43d2affc96/PFChM4Di_histology.pdf","original_filename":"PFC-hM4Di_histology.pdf"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/90f06480-c17a-4ac5-be20-a9067893272b/","size":1165147,"uuid":"90f06480-c17a-4ac5-be20-a9067893272b","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2023-07-13T13:12:20.225561Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2023-07-13T13:12:20.099823Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/90f06480-c17a-4ac5-be20-a9067893272b/HhM4Di_histology.pdf","original_filename":"H-hM4Di_histology.pdf"}]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"type":{"id":1331,"createdAt":"2022-07-18T08:50:00.832Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q580922","name":"Preprint","schema":"CreativeWork"},"authors":[{"id":602,"createdAt":"2023-06-25T09:04:03.525Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-09T15:50:47.786Z","moduleId":794,"workspaceId":261,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":261,"createdAt":"2022-11-21T11:03:44.632Z","updatedAt":"2023-07-19T13:09:55.087Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"hartmannclara","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/1eb5d652-5c02-428c-8c6a-22c627571c01/-/crop/391x391/0,37/-/preview/","firstName":"Clara","lastName":"Hartmann","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"","url":null,"orcid":null}},{"id":606,"createdAt":"2023-06-29T08:42:53.486Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-10T07:13:29.159Z","moduleId":794,"workspaceId":430,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":1,"workspace":{"id":430,"createdAt":"2023-06-25T20:07:15.934Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-25T20:08:59.476Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"ambikamahajan","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=AmbikaMahajan","firstName":"Ambika","lastName":"Mahajan","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"She/Her","url":null,"orcid":null}},{"id":603,"createdAt":"2023-06-25T09:04:08.726Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-14T11:37:52.199Z","moduleId":794,"workspaceId":262,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":2,"workspace":{"id":262,"createdAt":"2022-11-21T12:32:57.147Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-21T12:34:49.162Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"lrazenberg","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=LRazenberg","firstName":"Lotte","lastName":"Razenberg","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":null,"orcid":null}},{"id":601,"createdAt":"2023-06-25T09:02:06.102Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-10T13:31:04.411Z","moduleId":794,"workspaceId":7,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":3,"workspace":{"id":7,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T09:22:31.096Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-10T13:09:35.003Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"maheshkarnani","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/5f36c8bd-7dc3-4857-8273-19a032f94a13/-/crop/268x268/0,36/-/preview/","firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Karnani","name":null,"bio":"Assistant Prof and group leader at VU CNCR Amsterdam.

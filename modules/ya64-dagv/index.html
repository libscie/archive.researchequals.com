<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>[Note: This is a re-posting of a series of related blogs related to conducting meta-analysis. Many of these blogs were highly popular, but at some point original website was discontinued and later blogs are scattered along the timeline on a new website. Here, I am bringing these blog posts in one place to make them findable.]</p>

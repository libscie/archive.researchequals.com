<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On 12 and 13 October 2021, the SensJus project convened a workshop on Health-Citizen Science Dilemmas under the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), at the Brocher Foundation, Geneva. The page of the event is available at https://www.brocher.ch/fr/events/417/health-citizen-science-dilemmas-under-the-gdpr.</p>
<p>The workshop explored the scarcely researched implications of the GDPR for the active sharing of (environmental) health data within the framework of Citizen Science projects.</p>
<p>We discussed how data processing requirements under the GDPR may affect the advancement of Citizen Science for (environmental) health research, from a theoretical and empirical perspective.</p>
<p>The workshop was accompanied by two artists, one who captured the discussions and interactions among the physical and virtual audiences with a live drawing approach, the other who worked and is working on realizing visual consent forms for the SensJus project.</p>
<p>As a result of our collective brainstorming and note-taking, we realized A booklet, which can be freely downloaded here: https://sensingforjustice.webnode.it/l/a-colourful-toolbox-health-citizen-science-under-the-gdpr/</p>

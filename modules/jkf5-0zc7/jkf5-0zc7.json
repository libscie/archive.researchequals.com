The summary: Many new tools are built in the effort to open science, some with the idea that their mere presence will resolve underlying problems. Making impactful cultural change, however, is an ongoing social effort. In this project, we team up with ResearchEquals to create a community of practice for modular publishing in the Netherlands. Specifically, we provide multiple training sessions on how to get started with publishing each step of the research process, accompanied by an ethnographic study of the participating researchers. To sustain the training materials beyond the grant runtime, we create an open educational handbook.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":24,"main":{"name":"20230509nwo.pdf","size":431989,"uuid":"135d44be-852e-4ca7-9022-baf4ab3d45de","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/135d44be-852e-4ca7-9022-baf4ab3d45de/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/135d44be-852e-4ca7-9022-baf4ab3d45de/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/15f9d40a-b448-44a6-867a-842e7cbcf8cb/","size":9457,"uuid":"15f9d40a-b448-44a6-867a-842e7cbcf8cb","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2023-05-08T13:48:34.149020Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2023-05-08T13:48:34.002725Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/15f9d40a-b448-44a6-867a-842e7cbcf8cb/20230509nwotimeline.xlsx","original_filename":"20230509nwo-timeline.xlsx"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/e5ba394d-ffab-43c1-8bfa-dbb736a21f32/","size":284684,"uuid":"e5ba394d-ffab-43c1-8bfa-dbb736a21f32","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2023-05-08T13:48:35.106394Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2023-05-08T13:48:34.968062Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/e5ba394d-ffab-43c1-8bfa-dbb736a21f32/20230509nwo.xlsx","original_filename":"20230509nwo.xlsx"}]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"type":{"id":24,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q947859","name":"Research proposal","schema":"CreativeWork"},"authors":[{"id":564,"createdAt":"2023-05-08T13:46:17.637Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-09T12:35:37.186Z","moduleId":744,"workspaceId":405,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":405,"createdAt":"2023-05-08T13:35:48.578Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-21T08:25:16.031Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"dvr","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/fef9bc8a-784c-4f21-858d-158296692bca/-/crop/451x451/0,30/-/preview/","firstName":"Don","lastName":"van Ravenzwaaij","name":null,"bio":"Professor @University of Groningen, Bayesian Inference, computational methods, reproducibility.

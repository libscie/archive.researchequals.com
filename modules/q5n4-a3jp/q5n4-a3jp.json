We have tested our approach on a SARS-CoV-2 dataset with over 7800 fragments and on a dataset that contains all alternative sequences of the highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":450,"main":{"name":"Poster.pdf","size":1104825,"uuid":"5994fe2a-b10a-41e1-a4a3-ed442acffb98","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/5994fe2a-b10a-41e1-a4a3-ed442acffb98/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/5994fe2a-b10a-41e1-a4a3-ed442acffb98/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":129,"createdAt":"2022-03-12T17:40:36.664Z","updatedAt":"2022-03-12T17:41:16.876Z","moduleId":134,"workspaceId":61,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":61,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T18:07:50.596Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-01T18:10:52.489Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"gdv","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/b89f74fa-6ecb-4448-93cf-515f715c470d/","firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Della Vedova","name":null,"bio":"Associate Professor at Univ.

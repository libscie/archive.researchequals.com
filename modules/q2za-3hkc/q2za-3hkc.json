This is particularly important for studying prey species like the mouse, as handler-free measurement of exploitation behaviours will likely capture a different behavioural regime than traditional assays due to the lack of threatening stimuli. Following up on recent discussions of ethological neuroscience, three principles of automated maze development are outlined here, which have helped us to spatially discretize behavioural cycles in a naturalistic way.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":1,"main":{"name":"idea 1 discretized behavioural cycle recording.docx","size":168386,"uuid":"730e3536-6219-439f-b631-70f1cd7b8ced","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/730e3536-6219-439f-b631-70f1cd7b8ced/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/730e3536-6219-439f-b631-70f1cd7b8ced/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","type":"application","subtype":"vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":342,"createdAt":"2022-11-18T18:47:31.172Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-09T13:18:13.767Z","moduleId":437,"workspaceId":7,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":7,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T09:22:31.096Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-10T13:09:35.003Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"maheshkarnani","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/5f36c8bd-7dc3-4857-8273-19a032f94a13/-/crop/268x268/0,36/-/preview/","firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Karnani","name":null,"bio":"Assistant Prof and group leader at VU CNCR Amsterdam.

Inflexible repetitive behaviours are a hallmark of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Studies of the neural mechanisms underlying motivated behaviours, i.e., drives, seldom focus on switching between them. This is partly due to a lack of appropriate behavioural measurement systems. In this study, we build and test a device for measuring motivational switching in mice, the Switchmaze. We present build instructions using affordable off-the-shelf components, and openly accessible acquisition and analysis scripts.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":12,"main":{"name":"build

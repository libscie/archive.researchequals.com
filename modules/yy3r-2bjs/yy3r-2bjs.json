People of similar life history strategies, values, socioeconomic statuses, age, IQs, EQs, and genetics, TEND TO attract each other as romantic mates. Hereditarianism is both morally and factually wrong. Marginalized groups are more entitled to identity politics, to protect their human rights and negative utilitarianism. Educational websites may especially have skin in the game. Life history strategy applies to humans as well. Romances require enough shared values to operate. Higher socioeconomic status, IQs, EQs, and genetic commonality, excluding 2nd cousins and closer, attract romantic partners. Lacking white privilege and being mixed race can bring serious trauma, and solutions MAY, or may not, develop.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":16,"main":{"name":"CommonalitiesTENDTOAttract2 (2).pdf","size":405028,"uuid":"ef7aafe8-c574-42fd-84ac-73df7f7c3de7","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/ef7aafe8-c574-42fd-84ac-73df7f7c3de7/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/ef7aafe8-c574-42fd-84ac-73df7f7c3de7/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":1050,"createdAt":"2025-11-23T16:58:34.912Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T17:04:23.370Z","moduleId":1329,"workspaceId":743,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":743,"createdAt":"2025-11-23T05:32:27.138Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T17:07:38.432Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"crcguy","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=CRCguy","firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Ohnemus","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"He/him","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Minister-Alexander-Ohnemus","orcid":null}}],"license":{"id":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","name":"CC0 Public Domain Dedication","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VJdtMgxTMRvS"},"type":{"id":16,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q217602","name":"Analysis","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

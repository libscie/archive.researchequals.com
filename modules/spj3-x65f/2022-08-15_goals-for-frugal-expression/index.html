<h1>Frugal Protein Expression for PCR &amp; Pizza</h1>
<p>The community lab <a href="https://biotechwithoutborders.org">Biotech Without Borders</a> has run a free event called PCR &amp; Pizza where participants come to isolate their DNA from cheek cells, place their DNA into PCR reactions, and share in a conversation about biotech over pizza. Later a volunteer runs these reactions in a thermocycler and on an agarose gel. The results are reported back to the participants as a educational exercise in looking at the genotypes according to the CCR5 {delta}32 locus.</p>
<p>In the interest of lowering the costs for this workshop, cellular reagents could be prepared for polymerase. Research in the methods for accomplishing such a feat would contribute to global efforts to better document the process of making enzymes used as biotech reagents. Furthermore, well-documented protocols would provide an opportunity for volunteers to participate in preparing the materials for PCR &amp; Pizza. Ultimately this would serve to develop and highlight the capacity to create low-cost enzyme reagents within small community labs.</p>
<h2>Objective(s)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lower the cost of the PCR &amp; Pizza event
<ul>
<li>An inexpensive <a href="https://www.goldbio.com/product/taq-dna-polymerase">Taq polymerase</a> can currently be purchased for 5000U @ 510.00 USD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide a protocol that can engage volunteers with little-to-no bench experience, enabling them to prepare cellular reagents for the event</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Cellular reagents are a low-complexity approach to creating enzymes for use in various assays in a biotech lab. Since it does not require the purification of protein, once the use of such a reagent is validated in a specific assay preparation of the reagent is relatively straight forward. However, since cellular components may interfere with the assay, validation of the assay becomes a critical step.</p>
<p>The PCR &amp; Pizza event has traditionally used genotyping the CCR5 {delta}32 locus as target. In order to be considered successful in producing a cellular reagent we can use in a community lab, we need to validate the ability of this reagent to perform the CCR5 PCR reaction.</p>
<h2>Other Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to replication of the cellular reagents work which can be used in areas without access to distribution networks for biotech research enzymes</li>
<li>Create volunteer opportunities for Biotech Without Borders</li>
</ul>

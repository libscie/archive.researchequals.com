<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Cellular reagents could be prepared for polymerase to lower the cost of reagents for PCR-based workshops delivered as outreach out of community labs. Research in the methods for accomplishing such a feat would contribute to global efforts to better document the process of making enzymes used as biotech reagents at the small-scale. Furthermore, well-documented protocols would provide an opportunity for volunteers to participate in preparing the materials for PCR &amp; Pizza. Ultimately this would serve to develop and highlight the capacity to create low-cost enzyme reagents within community labs.</p>

# Frugal Protein Expression for PCR & Pizza

The community lab [Biotech Without Borders](https://biotechwithoutborders.org) has run a free event called PCR & Pizza where participants come to isolate their DNA from cheek cells, place their DNA into PCR reactions, and share in a conversation about biotech over pizza. Later a volunteer runs these reactions in a thermocycler and on an agarose gel. The results are reported back to the participants as a educational exercise in looking at the genotypes according to the CCR5 {delta}32 locus.

In the interest of lowering the costs for this workshop, cellular reagents could be prepared for polymerase. Research in the methods for accomplishing such a feat would contribute to global efforts to better document the process of making enzymes used as biotech reagents. Furthermore, well-documented protocols would provide an opportunity for volunteers to participate in preparing the materials for PCR & Pizza. Ultimately this would serve to develop and highlight the capacity to create low-cost enzyme reagents within small community labs.

## Objective(s)

* Lower the cost of the PCR & Pizza event
  * An inexpensive [Taq polymerase](https://www.goldbio.com/product/taq-dna-polymerase) can currently be purchased for 5000U @ 510.00 USD
* Provide a protocol that can engage volunteers with little-to-no bench experience, enabling them to prepare cellular reagents for the event

## Proposed Solution

Cellular reagents are a low-complexity approach to creating enzymes for use in various assays in a biotech lab. Since it does not require the purification of protein, once the use of such a reagent is validated in a specific assay preparation of the reagent is relatively straight forward. However, since cellular components may interfere with the assay, validation of the assay becomes a critical step.

The PCR & Pizza event has traditionally used genotyping the CCR5 {delta}32 locus as target. In order to be considered successful in producing a cellular reagent we can use in a community lab, we need to validate the ability of this reagent to perform the CCR5 PCR reaction.

## Other Benefits

* Contribute to replication of the cellular reagents work which can be used in areas without access to distribution networks for biotech research enzymes
* Create volunteer opportunities for Biotech Without Borders

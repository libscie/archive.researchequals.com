<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Replication of Petiska, 2023, but with manual coding of Google Scholar citations, as ChatGPT cannot give number of citations (don’t know how Petiska managed to make ChatGPT regurgitate Google Scholar citation counts)</li>
<li>I literally looked up every single reference from ChatGPT in order to manually put every little piece of metadata into a spreadsheet</li>
<li>Just wanting to provide the data for any curious person out there, so no analyses or results</li>
<li>Also, I wanted to provide the raw outputs from ChatGPT – They’re starting at “#1 Subdiscipline Summaries” – Making this research as open as possible</li>
<li>All of this took me from April 17th, up until April 26th, and it required a (stable) Internet connection, some nice 2000’s R&amp;B and patience to look things up</li>
</ul>

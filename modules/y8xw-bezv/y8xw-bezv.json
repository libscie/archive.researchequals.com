This work introduces a decentralized framework that utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to transform the way astronomical data is stored, retrieved, and shared. By integrating decentralized application architectures with established astronomical data protocols, this research establishes a foundational layer that promotes enhanced data redundancy, resilience, and scalability, thereby addressing critical limitations inherent in traditional centralized systems.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":450,"main":{"name":"Screenshot 2025-08-13 at 1.53.38â€¯PM.png","size":165720,"uuid":"651d917e-6330-40e3-a4da-101be8fc8c12","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/651d917e-6330-40e3-a4da-101be8fc8c12/","isImage":true,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"image/png","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/651d917e-6330-40e3-a4da-101be8fc8c12/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":{"dpi":null,"width":643,"format":"PNG","height":462,"sequence":false,"color_mode":"RGBA","orientation":null,"geo_location":null,"datetime_original":null},"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"image/png","type":"image","subtype":"png"},"image":{"dpi":null,"width":643,"format":"PNG","height":462,"sequence":false,"color_mode":"RGBA","orientation":null,"geo_location":null,"datetime_original":null}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":989,"createdAt":"2025-08-13T19:34:07.160Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-13T19:36:09.683Z","moduleId":1244,"workspaceId":700,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":700,"createdAt":"2025-08-13T19:29:42.206Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-13T19:32:38.863Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"josh","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/645359bf-2f92-422d-a086-1dbc2cea7bfc/","firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Universe","name":null,"bio":"Josh Universe is an American scientist-astronaut candidate, science communicator, and Founder of the International Biohacking Community.","pronouns":"he/him","url":"https://joshuniverse.com","orcid":"0009-0003-5395-3235"}}],"license":{"id":2,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"CC BY 4.0","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VKT0n4i9hFlz"},"type":{"id":450,"createdAt":"2022-02-08T15:53:02.910Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q429785","name":"Poster","schema":"Poster"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

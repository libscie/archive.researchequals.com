By analyzing Federal Reserve data on commercial bank assets and liabilities between 2017 and 2024, the study identifies a statistically significant spike in money supply immediately following these policy shifts. Between November 2019 and May 2020, commercial bank assets and liabilities rose over three standard deviations above the average growth rate, reflecting an unprecedented expansion of available credit and deposits. The analysis contrasts these effects with other potential inflation drivers, such as fiscal stimulus payments, and finds that monetary factors had a more pronounced impact on inflationary trends. Comparative cases from Saudi Arabia and Brazil further illustrate the effectiveness of reserve requirement adjustments as a tool to manage inflation. The paper concludes that while the Federal Reserve’s actions were aimed at preventing financial collapse during an unprecedented crisis, the simultaneous use of easy-lending mechanisms without offsetting controls led to excessive liquidity and sustained inflation. The study calls for more balanced and data-informed coordination of reserve requirements, interest rate policy, and quantitative easing to ensure long-term economic stability in future crises.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":1331,"main":{"name":"Easy Lending_v2.pdf","size":210616,"uuid":"199ffd2d-de23-4cf6-9462-f5a84d0d2b7c","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/199ffd2d-de23-4cf6-9462-f5a84d0d2b7c/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/199ffd2d-de23-4cf6-9462-f5a84d0d2b7c/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[{"id":1267,"createdAt":"2025-10-08T20:51:03.069Z","updatedAt":"2025-10-08T20:51:03.069Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2025-10-08T20:32:25.000Z","publishedWhere":"Zenodo","originMetadata":"DataCite","url":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17298284","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.5281","suffix":"zenodo.17298284","title":"Easy Lending: How the Federal Reserve's Response to Covid Helped Cause America's High Inflation","description":"This paper examines how the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic—specifically the elimination of reserve requirements, expansion of quantitative easing, and lowering of interest rates—contributed to the surge in U.S. inflation following 2020.

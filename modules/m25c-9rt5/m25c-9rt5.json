Tipler's Omega Point theory more parsimoniously aligns with universal apotheosis than the Abrahamic God, given life's unfairness and undeserved suffering, which suggest that all beings achieve godhood across infinite multiversal possibilities rather than relying on a singular entity that equally cares for all. Supporting this, the CIA's Gateway Process favors pantheism over monotheism, Julian Jaynes' bicameral mind theory implies polytheism, Dr. Jacobo Grinberg's lattice method draws from shamanic paganism, Diodorus of Sicily viewed Greek gods as immortalized historical figures, traditional ancestor worship emphasizes elder respect leading to deification, Brian C. Muraresku's pantheistic reading of the Bible, the Cult of Dionysus' transformation of mortals into gods, biblical quotes from Jesus advocating universal apotheosis, Ludwig Feuerbach's alienation theory, René Girard's mimetic theory, and additional arguments from multiversal infinity and suffering collectively favor emergent, inclusive divinity over monotheistic frameworks. Drawing on scholarly sources, this analysis highlights parsimony through natural, cultural, and physical processes.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":24,"main":{"name":"a-parsimonious-case-for-universal-apotheosis-integrating-cosmology-consciousness-and-cultural-theories-over-monotheism.pdf","size":193740,"uuid":"8bdc0a3b-dd72-4e42-b0dd-569dc84b07f1","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/8bdc0a3b-dd72-4e42-b0dd-569dc84b07f1/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/8bdc0a3b-dd72-4e42-b0dd-569dc84b07f1/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":1043,"createdAt":"2025-11-23T05:35:15.570Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T05:40:04.345Z","moduleId":1322,"workspaceId":743,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":743,"createdAt":"2025-11-23T05:32:27.138Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T17:07:38.432Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"crcguy","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=CRCguy","firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Ohnemus","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"He/him","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Minister-Alexander-Ohnemus","orcid":null}}],"license":{"id":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","name":"CC0 Public Domain Dedication","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VJdtMgxTMRvS"},"type":{"id":24,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q947859","name":"Research proposal","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

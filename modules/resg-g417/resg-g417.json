Yet, many local-level stakeholder groups, such as anglers, continue to support the use of hatcheries as a means of conserving declining wild fish stocks, particularly for Atlantic salmon. Could it be that their interest and support of hatcheries is about more than the fish they produce? In this paper, we explore the different kinds of social, psychological, and conservation benefits produced by hatcheries in three European case studies.\n\nThis article was originally published in Fisheries Research.\n\nThis paper was authored by Hannah L Harrison, Sophia Kochalski, Robert Arlinghaus, and Øystein Aas.

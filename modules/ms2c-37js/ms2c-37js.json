Stories may engage brain processes of identification, whereby each story character is understood through the listeners perception of oneself.\nBrain responses should depend on the personality traits of the involved story characters but, I hypothesis, also on personality traits of the listener.\nI predict that brain responses to stories will be more similar amongst individuals with similar than dissimilar personality traits.\nIf confirmed, this could open the door to the objective determination of personality structure and assist therapy.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":6,"main":{"name":"fMRIpersonality.txt","size":697,"uuid":"e5d22cec-e0a3-4983-8e36-5659c663a4ed","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/e5d22cec-e0a3-4983-8e36-5659c663a4ed/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"mimeType":"text/plain","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/e5d22cec-e0a3-4983-8e36-5659c663a4ed/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":332,"createdAt":"2022-11-17T03:38:26.576Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-17T03:42:10.854Z","moduleId":430,"workspaceId":256,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":256,"createdAt":"2022-11-17T02:27:09.635Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-17T02:58:01.085Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"proulx_s","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/8b5bc191-45e2-4e60-bb18-719ae6066e07/-/crop/1582x1581/403,63/-/preview/","firstName":"SÃ©bastien","lastName":"Proulx","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":null,"orcid":"0000-0003-1709-3277"}}],"license":{"id":2,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"CC BY 4.0","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VKT0n4i9hFlz"},"type":{"id":6,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q41719","name":"Hypothesis","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

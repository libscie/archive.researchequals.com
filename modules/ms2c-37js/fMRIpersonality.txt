Brain responses recorded with fMRI during movie viewing show remarkable 
similarity across individuals despite the uncontrolled nature of the task. 
Stories may engage brain processes of identification, whereby each story 
character is understood through the listeners perception of oneself. Brain 
responses should depend on the personality traits of the involved story 
characters but, I hypothesis, also on personality traits of the listener. 
I predict that brain responses to stories will be more similar amongst 
individuals with similar than dissimilar personality traits. If confirmed, 
this could open the door to the objective determination of personality 
structure and assist therapy.

However, we show how through stricter rules for guideline committee entry, conflicts of interest can largely be avoided. In addition, transparent application of sensitivity analysis in benefit harm analysis (BHA) helps to steer clear of the problems around subjectivity addressed in the Editorial.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":24790,"main":{"name":"Mitigating intersubjective variability in clinical guidelines - ViewPoint - Yebyo-Puhan-Ter Riet.pdf","size":246025,"uuid":"901889ce-4072-40c4-ad9c-bcb4335c2123","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/901889ce-4072-40c4-ad9c-bcb4335c2123/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/901889ce-4072-40c4-ad9c-bcb4335c2123/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":1051,"createdAt":"2025-11-24T12:23:47.767Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T12:24:30.688Z","moduleId":1330,"workspaceId":146,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":146,"createdAt":"2022-03-13T19:58:59.360Z","updatedAt":"2025-09-18T15:40:15.113Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"grietter","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/35d93b72-5eb1-44a7-b98b-9ab7f8e7ef86/-/crop/450x451/0,6/-/preview/","firstName":"Gerben","lastName":"ter Riet","name":null,"bio":"Senior scientific adviser at the Faculty of Health, Sport & Exercise of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Urban Vitality Centre of Expertise) and associate professor of epidemiology at the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Dept.

Players have to guess what are the most common answers given by members of the Open Science community, collected via a survey with Open Science related questions.\n\nThis game is the outcome of our working group in the Open Science Retreat 2025. The retreat had about 50 participants. Thus, we wanted to have a game that allows for a large number of players. However, we also included instruction on how to use it in smaller groups (about 10 people).","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":17,"main":{"name":"README.md","size":4674,"uuid":"b726646c-28b3-4472-a3ae-d669508b3751","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/b726646c-28b3-4472-a3ae-d669508b3751/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"text/markdown","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/b726646c-28b3-4472-a3ae-d669508b3751/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"text/plain","type":"text","subtype":"plain"}}},"supporting":{"files":[{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/41d80885-27f5-493b-95e9-bdd01e00cdf0/","size":283092,"uuid":"41d80885-27f5-493b-95e9-bdd01e00cdf0","source":null,"is_image":true,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","image_info":{"dpi":null,"width":2048,"format":"JPEG","height":1276,"sequence":false,"color_mode":"RGB","orientation":null,"geo_location":null,"datetime_original":null},"datetime_stored":"2025-04-17T08:18:27.788404Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-04-17T08:18:27.674474Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/41d80885-27f5-493b-95e9-bdd01e00cdf0/logosurveysaysopenscience.jpg","original_filename":"logo

## Summary

**"Survey Says: Open Science!"** is a game inspired by Family Feud, an American television game show where teams compete to name the most popular answers to survey questions in order to win the game.

The goal of the game is to bring awareness on Open Science in a lighthearted way. Players have to guess what are the most common answers given by members of the Open Science community, collected via a survey with Open Science related questions. 

This game is the outcome of our working group in the Open Science Retreat 2025. The retreat had about 50 participants. Thus, we wanted to have a game that allows for a large number of players. However, we also included instruction on how to use it in smaller groups (about 10 people).   

In the package related to this project/outcome, you will find various resources. 

If you want to only play the game, please check the **slides** (.pptx) for the game instructions and the **game url** to play it. Otherwise, if you want to create your own version of the game or reuse materials, check the **game source code** (react app), **survey questionnaire** (.html), **survey answers and coding adopted** (.xlsx), and **game logo** (.jpeg).

## Game instructions

### Overview

The game is inspired by Family Feud, an American television game show where teams compete to name the most popular answers to survey questions in order to win the game. Survey Says: Open Science is aimed to spread awareness on how the community feels about Open Science.

### When to play

Survey Says: Open Science is most fun to play with groups of 8 or more people. We recommend playing at conferences, retreats or any large gathering of friends or colleagues.
Be prepared for lighthearted chatter, some surprises, and a big dose of cheering.

We recommend having three organizers: (1) the game host, (2) the technician / jury, (3) the helper to keep track of the points / another jury.

### Gameplay

Survey Says: Open Science has 9 rounds with one question per round. The game host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people. A number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey's responses. Game starts after the first question is revealed.

### Teams

Survey Says: Open Science is a team game. We recommend having at least 2 teams. Each team can have at most 6 players. If playing with a larger crowd, you can add more teams (max 8 teams).   

#### Playing with 2 teams

With a group up to around 12 pp: divide the participants in 2 teams of max 6 pp that play against each other. The teams take turns to try to guess a first entry. If one team does guess a first entry, the round is theirs to play. The other team can steal a point after team nr 1 gets 3 strikes. 

#### Playing with 3 or more teams

If there are more people than 12, more teams of max. 6 pp need to be formed. These teams have to bid on questions that they want to play. For this, each team receives 90,- in total for 9 questions: this means that the average bet is 10 points per round. Pun: the bids are also known as 'Question Processing Fees'. The teams will have 30 seconds to place a bid (use a timer app, such as [Online Stopwatch](https://stopwatch-app.com/nl/timer/30_seconden)). The team with the highest bid can play the round. If they get 3 strikes, the team with the 2nd highest bet can try to steal the round (see below how to steal points), than the 3rd etc.


### Playing

The group with the highest bid start the round. Group members take turns guessing the answers on the board. 
1. Five answers on the board -> 1 Winning Point
1. Answer not on the board -> A Strike 
1. Three Strikes -> No points 

The other team/the team with the second highest bid takes the turn. If team 2 guesses one answer correctly, they steal the points from the first team! If they miss, the next highest-bidding team can try if there are more than 2 teams playing.

### Winning

The team with the most points after 9 rounds wins the game. In case of a tie, a bonus round will be conducted.

#### Bonus round

A question from the 9 rounds will be picked by the jury. The teams will be asked to come up with the funniest answer to the question. After the teams reveal their answers, the crowd will decide which team has the funniest answer. This can be meassured by the loudnes of cheers/claps (for example, using a smartphone app). Funniest team will win the game.

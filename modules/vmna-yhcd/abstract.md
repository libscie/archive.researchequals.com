# Patterns of Linear Enamel Hypoplasia and Missing Teeth: What does it all mean and why should we care?

**Bj√∏rn Peare Bartholdy and Sarah Schrader**

Methods for scoring and analysing linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) in a sample vary widely.
Some methods suggest using a single tooth type (first incisor, second molar, etc.), and
others use only a single tooth; however, we know that some teeth, particularly anterior
teeth, are more prone to LEH, and missing values are a major limitation in archaeological
samples.

In this study we explore patterns of LEH in a sample of 1418 individuals (21402 teeth)
from the Wellcome Osteological Research Database. The sample had 1249 unique combinations
of scored and unscored teeth. Canines were score most often, and third molars the least.
Lesions are also most prevalent on canines (lesions on 46.7-54.4% of scored teeth),
followed by the incisors (24.8-32.2%), premolars (15.0-23.7%), and molars (2.9-13.5%).
From the original sample, we filtered individuals with complete dentitions
(not including third molars), resulting in a sample of 25 individuals with LEH scores
for all teeth. Here, 17 unique patterns of LEH lesions emerged. Lesion symmetry in antimeres
and isomeres were equally common (each present in six individuals), but symmetries were not
consistent across all teeth within an individual.

The large variation of patterns in LEH lesions complicates analysing LEH in samples with
missing data. We recommend targeting the anterior teeth as the most reliable indicators
of LEH presence, as lesions on the canines and incisors had the most symmetry. No single
tooth type showed consistent symmetry in LEH lesions to support using a single tooth type
for any kind of analysis.

The main way to identify a scientific article is through the persistent identifiers that journals assign to articles. There are a variety of persistent identifiers, with the Digital Object Identifier being the most used. The use and assignment of most persistent identifiers have an associated cost. Journals sometimes have difficulty covering this cost or transferring it to the authors of the articles, causing barriers to publishing scientific articles. This work aims to implement free persistent identifiers in a scientific journal management system. To accomplish this, software components for managing the persistent identifiers Archival Resource Key and Persistent Uniform Resource Locator are implemented for the Open Journal System. The results of implementing these persistent identifiers in a scientific journal are analyzed, as well as the implementation by the scientific community of 15 countries in 32 journals. Implementing free persistent identifiers in scientific journals allows for greater visibility and savings in publication costs.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9421-9529","given":"Yasiel","family":"Pérez Vera","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4810-1444","given":"Álvaro","family":"Fernández del Carpio","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":false}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":1159,"createdAt":"2025-05-15T11:43:11.550Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-15T11:43:11.550Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"Alternative Publishing Platforms","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.21428/996e2e37.0eafc1a8","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.21428","suffix":"996e2e37.0eafc1a8","title":"Knowledge Exchange Analysis Report on Alternative Publishing Platforms","description":null,"language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5366-7763","given":"Jean Francois","family":"Lutz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Lorraine"}],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9866-0239","given":"Jeroen","family":"Sondervan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dutch Research Council (NWO)"}],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2510-0529","given":"Xenia van","family":"Edig","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB)"}],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4115-161X","given":"Alexandra","family":"Freeman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cambridge University, Octopus"}],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5965-6560","given":"Bianca","family":"Kramer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Sesame Open Science"}],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0009-0000-8684-1668","given":"Claus Hansen","family":"Rosenkrantz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Copenhagen Business School"}],"authenticated-orcid":false}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":676,"createdAt":"2023-03-28T07:55:22.694Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-28T07:55:22.694Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"Nature","originMetadata":"CrossRef","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00861-0","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.1038","suffix":"d41586-023-00861-0","title":"Octopus and ResearchEquals aim to break the publishing mould","description":null,"language":"en","licenseId":1518,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Payal","family":"Dhar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]},{"id":1166,"createdAt":"2025-05-15T11:44:58.472Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-15T11:44:58.472Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"arXiv","originMetadata":"DataCite","url":"https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.01833","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.48550","suffix":"arxiv.2205.01833","title":"OpenAlex: A fully-open index of scholarly works, authors, venues, institutions, and concepts","description":"OpenAlex is a new, fully-open scientific knowledge graph (SKG), launched to replace the discontinued Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG).

Through an open consultation, 78 institutions, networks, communities and individuals previously contributed to the Ambition Document. The Rolling Agenda was then written by several writing teams, and has the support of partners involved in the NPOS Steering Committee, the Advisory Board and the Rolling Agenda editorial board. This latest version of the Ambition Document and Rolling Agenda has been presented to Minister Dijkgraaf. This marks the end of the National Programme Open Science. With 20 million euros made available annually by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to stimulate our Open Science ambitions, the facilitating role of the NPOS will be passed on to the Regieorgaan Open Science being set up within NWO. An important task of the Regieorgaan will be to enable the plans developed in recent years by providing temporary impulse funding. In addition, the Regieorgaan will play a role in continuing to bring parties, organisations and communities together at various levels, including the national administrative-level consultations on open science.

They do so by focusing on setting up horizontal alliances between independent projects within a certain sector (e.g., scholar-led presses), or vertically across sectors with other not-for-profit organisations (e.g., through collaborations with libraries, universities, and funders), in order to create multi-stakeholder ecologies within scholarly publishing. Yet at the same time, imaginaries for future modes of OA knowledge production are still controlled through demands for ‘scalability’ and ‘sustainability’, which are both seen as preconditions for scholarly communication models and practices to succeed and to be efficient. But they are also prerequi­sites to receive funding for publishing projects or infrastructure development. The scalability of open models is perceived as essential to compete in a landscape dominated by a handful of major corporate players.Drawing on our work with the Radical Open Access Collective, the ScholarLed consortium, and the Community-led Open Publishing Infrastructures for Mono­graphs (COPIM) project, this article outlines an alternative organisational prin­ciple for governing community-led publishing projects based on mutual reliance, care, and other forms of commoning. Termed ‘scaling small’, this principle eschews standard approaches to organisational growth that tend to flatten community diversity through economies of scale. Instead, it puts forward the idea that scale can be nurtured through intentional collaborations between community-driven pro­jects that promote a bibliodiverse ecosystem while providing resilience through resource sharing and other kinds of collaboration. Following Anna Tsing’s recom­mendations to keep in mind how reimagining our knowledge practices requires we pay particular attention to articulations between the scalable and the nonscalable (Tsing, 2012), what is needed to enable this is, first and foremost, a rethinking of existing systems and infrastructures and how they currently function – systems that have historically developed and been continuously remade to encourage fur­ther scalability. We further explore the possibilities of scaling small with particular reference to Anna Tsing’s work on the ‘latent commons’ and Massimo De Angelis’ discussion of ‘boundary commoning’, examining how these concepts are on display within the Radical Open Access Collective, ScholarLed and the COPIM project. As we will argue, reimagining the relations within publishing beyond a mere calcula­tive logic, i.e., one that is focused on assessing the sustainability of alternative models, is essential in not-for-profit OA publishing environments, particularly if we want new forms of collaboration to arise and to redefine the future of scholarly publishing in communal settings.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Janneke","family":"Adema","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Postdigital Cultures, Coventry University"}]},{"given":"Samuel A.","family":"Moore","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Postdigital Cultures, Coventry University"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"key":"keyref_B1","unstructured":"Adema, J. & Moore, S.

We propose a four-year, €1.5 million project to transform an existing, alternative publishing platform into readily deployable open infrastructure for research institutions of any size. In transforming an alternative publishing platform into deployable and sovereign infrastructure, we work towards one seamless, low-cost research environment for discovering, storing, publishing, and evaluating research outputs. Beyond transforming this alternative platform into alternative infrastructure, we extend it to be interoperable between institutions and with the wider social web. Each coalition partner works within their local institution to progressively adapt and enhance this alternative infrastructure to the institution’s needs and the needs of its researchers. \n\nWe transform and extend the alternative open-source publishing platform ResearchEquals. The foundational work (months 1-6) is to recruit staff and build trust within the coalition. The technical implementation happens in two sequential stages: Transformation (months 6-12) and extension (months 12-36). Parallel to the technical implementation, we “scale small” by working with local communities to deploy and adopt the infrastructure (months 6-48). During the entire project (months 0-48), the coalition will meet fortnightly to brainstorm activities, provide updates on local progress, and coordinate efforts to progressively adapt the infrastructure. When successful, this project builds readily reusable, open-source infrastructure run by institutions themselves.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":24,"main":{"name":"os-infra-preproposal.pdf","size":227855,"uuid":"f43cfa6e-091a-4179-9ac6-4df39f1d41e1","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/f43cfa6e-091a-4179-9ac6-4df39f1d41e1/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/f43cfa6e-091a-4179-9ac6-4df39f1d41e1/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"type":{"id":24,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q947859","name":"Research proposal","schema":"CreativeWork"},"authors":[{"id":826,"createdAt":"2024-11-04T12:25:43.552Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-05T13:37:40.627Z","moduleId":1077,"workspaceId":39,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":39,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T12:40:27.581Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-13T19:50:44.695Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"nsunami","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/f32b045e-382e-4899-a123-9442c1b5e806/","firstName":"Nami","lastName":"Sunami","name":null,"bio":"Research Data Steward ","pronouns":"he/him","url":"https://naoyukiasunami.com/","orcid":"0000-0001-5482-8370"}},{"id":827,"createdAt":"2024-11-04T12:25:55.360Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-06T09:45:20.017Z","moduleId":1077,"workspaceId":387,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":1,"workspace":{"id":387,"createdAt":"2023-04-14T08:09:46.249Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-14T09:33:04.399Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"annaveer","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/85be0203-e5ff-4653-b974-1055996a278c/","firstName":"Anna","lastName":"van 't Veer","name":null,"bio":"Assistant prof @ Leiden University, the Netherlands.

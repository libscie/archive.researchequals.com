The summary: Many new tools are built in the effort to open science, some with the idea that their mere presence will resolve underlying problems. Making impactful cultural change, however, is an ongoing social effort. In this project, we team up with ResearchEquals to create a community of practice for modular publishing in the Netherlands. Specifically, we provide multiple training sessions on how to get started with publishing each step of the research process, accompanied by an ethnographic study of the participating researchers. To sustain the training materials beyond the grant runtime, we create an open educational handbook.","language":"en","licenseId":1,"moduleTypeId":24,"main":{"name":"20230509nwo.pdf","size":431989,"uuid":"135d44be-852e-4ca7-9022-baf4ab3d45de","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/135d44be-852e-4ca7-9022-baf4ab3d45de/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/135d44be-852e-4ca7-9022-baf4ab3d45de/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/15f9d40a-b448-44a6-867a-842e7cbcf8cb/","size":9457,"uuid":"15f9d40a-b448-44a6-867a-842e7cbcf8cb","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2023-05-08T13:48:34.149020Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2023-05-08T13:48:34.002725Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/15f9d40a-b448-44a6-867a-842e7cbcf8cb/20230509nwotimeline.xlsx","original_filename":"20230509nwo-timeline.xlsx"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/e5ba394d-ffab-43c1-8bfa-dbb736a21f32/","size":284684,"uuid":"e5ba394d-ffab-43c1-8bfa-dbb736a21f32","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2023-05-08T13:48:35.106394Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2023-05-08T13:48:34.968062Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/e5ba394d-ffab-43c1-8bfa-dbb736a21f32/20230509nwo.xlsx","original_filename":"20230509nwo.xlsx"}]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[{"id":224,"createdAt":"2022-08-01T08:47:33.038Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-21T12:36:20.147Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2022-09-21T12:36:19.000Z","publishedWhere":"ResearchEquals","originMetadata":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://doi.org/10.53962/g9j4-v2gy","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.53962","suffix":"g9j4-v2gy","title":"Aggregate dataset of open data without identifying information","description":"This module contains a principal dataset collated from various open data, which we previously identified as not containing identifying information.

Overall, technical identifiers are highly specific and sensitive (e.g., email, IP addresses), except for IMEI numbers (hardware numbers for phones). Phone numbers can be detected if reported in their international form (e.g., +1 555 55 555). For location information, regular expressions are highly precise in the case of latitude/longitude combinations, but not for street addresses (sensitive but not specific). For direct identifiers, we see that gender is hardest to detect with high specificity, but given the risk of disclosing marginalized gender identities, we consider this important to check for nonetheless (specificity gets worse as the dataset is larger in size). Similar issues exist for credit card information, where the risk is high if disclosed. As a result, we recommend scanning for all identifying information looked into in this report, except for IMEI and street addresses, as they underperform.

In contrast, alternative seafood networks (ASNs) that distribute seafood through local and direct marketing channels were identified as a “bright spot”. In this paper, we draw on multiple lines of quantitative and qualitative evidence to show that ASNs experienced a temporary pandemic “bump” in both the United States and Canada in the wake of supply chain disruptions and government mandated social protections. We use a systemic resilience framework to analyze the factors that enabled ASNs to be resilient during the pandemic as well as challenges. The contrast between ASNs and the broader seafood system during COVID-19 raises important questions about the role that local and regional food systems may play during crises and highlights the need for functional diversity in supply chains.\n\nThis paper was authored by Joshua S Stoll, Hannah L Harrison, Emily De Sousa, Debra Callaway, Melissa Collier, Kelly Harrell, Buck Jones, Jordyn Kastlunger, Emma Kramer, Steve Kurian, M Alan Lovewell, Sonia Strobel, Tracy Sylvester, Brett Tolley, Andrea Tomlinson, Easton R White, Talia Young, Philip A Loring.\n\nThis paper was originally published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":4979,"main":{"name":"Stoll et al.

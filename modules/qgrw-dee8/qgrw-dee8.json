This discussion has led to changes in psychology’s approach to research, and several new initiatives have been developed, many with the aim of improving our findings. One key advancement is the marked increase in the number of replication studies conducted. We argue that while it is important to conduct replications as part of regular research protocol, it is neither efficient nor useful to replicate results at random. We recommend adopting a methodical approach toward the selection of replication targets to maximize the impact of the outcomes of those replications, and minimize waste of scarce resources. In the current study, we demonstrate how a Bayesian re–analysis of existing research findings followed by a simple qualitative assessment process can drive the selection of the best candidate article for replication.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":49,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7874-1261","given":"Sarahanne M.","family":"Field","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychometrics and Statistics, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, NL"}],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"given":"Rink","family":"Hoekstra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychometrics and Statistics, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, NL"}]},{"given":"Laura","family":"Bringmann","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychometrics and Statistics, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, NL"}]},{"given":"Don","family":"van Ravenzwaaij","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychometrics and Statistics, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, NL"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0182651","key":"2020111813280536000_B1","year":"2017","volume":"12","article-title":"Estimating the evidential value of significant results in psychological science","journal-title":"PLOS ONE","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"2020111813280536000_B2","unstructured":"Aschwanden,C.

The paper focuses on measures for calculating the landmark salience of geographic features in rural areas. Two models are examined: one explicitly designed to identify landmarks in rural areas, and one originally focused on urban areas. The identified landmarks are compared with those from a survey. The results show that the differences between the models and the survey results are not statistically significant. The results of the two models are statistically significantly different. The first model identifies highly semantically salient geographic features as landmarks, while the second model does not consider semantic salience and prefers natural geographic features.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":1332,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"name":"Nuhn, Eva","givenName":"Eva","familyName":"Nuhn","affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":"https://orcid.org","nameIdentifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2443-8122","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{},"authors":[]}],"authors":[{"id":878,"createdAt":"2025-04-02T23:02:35.672Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-06T12:03:07.339Z","moduleId":1116,"workspaceId":30,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":30,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T10:24:05.992Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-01T10:29:33.199Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"nuest","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/89bd200e-b85a-4ff1-933d-84fb3db03d9b/","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Nüst","name":null,"bio":"Daniel is a research software engineer and PhD student at the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster, Germany.

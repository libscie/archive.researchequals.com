The checklist will reach its maximum potential if the management of knowledge centers and CoEs use the checklist as a policy tool and organize their pre-award and post-award research processes around the checklist items. Annually, for example, a data steward could check with researchers on a project in an open dialogue to see which of the 14 items have been met.

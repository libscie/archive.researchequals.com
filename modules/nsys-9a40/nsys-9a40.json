All figures could be recreated with the original code and data as described in the README file. Only the computing environment could not be recreated exactly, as a lot of time has passed since the publication of the original code. Both a quick (saved data) execution and a longer (seemingly new data) execution were successful and yielded figures who by visual inspection matched the figures in the original article. Errors and warnings were mostly related to deprecation of libraries and missing libraries.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":4636,"main":{"name":"codecheck.pdf","size":2044433,"uuid":"054364eb-491e-4eb3-b629-0f812fd34e6a","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/054364eb-491e-4eb3-b629-0f812fd34e6a/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"application/pdf","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/054364eb-491e-4eb3-b629-0f812fd34e6a/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"application/pdf","type":"application","subtype":"pdf"}}},"supporting":{"files":[{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/ab1b7d1b-9be8-4cc8-8d9a-f3eac7c99d9e/","size":141,"uuid":"ab1b7d1b-9be8-4cc8-8d9a-f3eac7c99d9e","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/x-yaml","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2025-05-20T13:08:37.383625Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-05-20T13:08:37.243317Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/ab1b7d1b-9be8-4cc8-8d9a-f3eac7c99d9e/environment.yml","original_filename":"environment.yml"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/9c632dd0-0209-49e0-93c2-3d3cd1671490/","size":46049,"uuid":"9c632dd0-0209-49e0-93c2-3d3cd1671490","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"text/plain","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2025-05-20T13:08:37.667061Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-05-20T13:08:37.457800Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/9c632dd0-0209-49e0-93c2-3d3cd1671490/lognewtrue.txt","original_filename":"log-new-true.txt"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/b4e9a882-6f14-468d-bb81-3a6103fd62e6/","size":1749196,"uuid":"b4e9a882-6f14-468d-bb81-3a6103fd62e6","source":null,"is_image":true,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"image/png","image_info":{"dpi":null,"width":3662,"format":"PNG","height":2065,"sequence":false,"color_mode":"RGBA","orientation":null,"geo_location":null,"datetime_original":null},"datetime_stored":"2025-05-20T13:08:39.250805Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-05-20T13:08:39.039318Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/b4e9a882-6f14-468d-bb81-3a6103fd62e6/screenshotfigure1to11.png","original_filename":"screenshot-figure-1-to-11.png"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/9b081730-e0af-445a-a95c-c0215ed8d3ac/","size":22648,"uuid":"9b081730-e0af-445a-a95c-c0215ed8d3ac","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2025-05-20T13:09:41.333684Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-05-20T13:09:41.193225Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/9b081730-e0af-445a-a95c-c0215ed8d3ac/figure_5_created_250520.pdf","original_filename":"figure_5_created_250520.pdf"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/1439ea37-1a9b-4a68-b789-eab795996e5b/","size":12103,"uuid":"1439ea37-1a9b-4a68-b789-eab795996e5b","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2025-05-20T13:09:41.165391Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-05-20T13:09:41.033385Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/1439ea37-1a9b-4a68-b789-eab795996e5b/figure_6_created_250520.pdf","original_filename":"figure_6_created_250520.pdf"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/51021f3d-36ae-4283-9b09-20dc983bdb77/","size":21465,"uuid":"51021f3d-36ae-4283-9b09-20dc983bdb77","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2025-05-20T13:09:41.108342Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-05-20T13:09:40.982318Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/51021f3d-36ae-4283-9b09-20dc983bdb77/figure_7CD_seed28_created_250520.pdf","original_filename":"figure_7CD_seed28_created_250520.pdf"},{"url":"https://api.uploadcare.com/files/72ef1f9f-8e2b-423a-b8c8-211b7f85c686/","size":13687,"uuid":"72ef1f9f-8e2b-423a-b8c8-211b7f85c686","source":null,"is_image":false,"is_ready":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","image_info":null,"datetime_stored":"2025-05-20T13:09:41.242758Z","default_effects":"","datetime_removed":null,"datetime_uploaded":"2025-05-20T13:09:41.066376Z","original_file_url":"https://ucarecdn.com/72ef1f9f-8e2b-423a-b8c8-211b7f85c686/figure_8_created_250520.pdf","original_filename":"figure_8_created_250520.pdf"}]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":940,"createdAt":"2025-05-20T13:06:04.658Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-20T13:10:30.184Z","moduleId":1170,"workspaceId":30,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":30,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T10:24:05.992Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-01T10:29:33.199Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"nuest","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/89bd200e-b85a-4ff1-933d-84fb3db03d9b/","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Nüst","name":null,"bio":"Da

Our goal is twofold: to provide descriptive information on these understudied aspects of the food system and to also contribute to the broader discussion of wild food harvests in the lives and experiences of urban residents, where the issues of peopleâ€™s connections with nature, tradition and self-determination, sustainability, and social and environmental justice all arguably converge.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":4979,"main":{"name":"Harrison and Loring urban harvests MP3.mp3","size":60387885,"uuid":"7731e6c7-6dcb-43e1-a694-49f6055e60aa","cdnUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/7731e6c7-6dcb-43e1-a694-49f6055e60aa/","isImage":false,"isStored":true,"metadata":{},"mimeType":"audio/mpeg","sourceInfo":{"file":{},"source":"local"},"originalUrl":"https://ucarecdn.com/7731e6c7-6dcb-43e1-a694-49f6055e60aa/","cdnUrlModifiers":null,"originalImageInfo":null,"originalVideoInfo":null,"originalContentInfo":{"mime":{"mime":"audio/mpeg","type":"audio","subtype":"mpeg"}}},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{},"referencesRaw":{},"references":[],"authors":[{"id":456,"createdAt":"2023-02-21T15:45:07.395Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-22T13:12:52.691Z","moduleId":531,"workspaceId":298,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":298,"createdAt":"2023-01-18T13:51:49.836Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-15T16:12:58.276Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"fishpeopleplace","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/eafd4f71-1a3d-4440-8dc9-3abb0ca3d8c9/-/crop/391x391/0,85/-/preview/","firstName":"Hannah L.","lastName":"Harrison","name":null,"bio":"Assistant Professor at Dalhousie University, Marine Affairs Program","pronouns":"she/her","url":null,"orcid":"0000-0002-1411-4039"}},{"id":457,"createdAt":"2023-02-21T15:45:17.500Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-22T16:21:23.336Z","moduleId":531,"workspaceId":318,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":true,"authorshipRank":1,"workspace":{"id":318,"createdAt":"2023-02-21T15:20:38.844Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-21T16:06:35.285Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"conservechange","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/c671c103-92d2-45ed-8dde-9f381b1ddf57/","firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Loring","name":null,"bio":"Human ecologist with research on food systems, fisheries, and sustainability","pronouns":"he/him/they","url":"https://spore.social/@ConserveChange","orcid":"0000-0001-6039-2331"}}],"license":{"id":2,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"CC BY 4.0","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VKT0n4i9hFlz"},"type":{"id":4979,"createdAt":"2023-02-20T19:36:40.966Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q7257257","name":"Pubcast","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

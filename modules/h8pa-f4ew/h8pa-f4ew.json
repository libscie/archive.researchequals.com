These developments and insights have been included in the NPOS2030 Ambition Document and Rolling Agenda, or will play a role as we collectively move into a new implementation phase. Through an open consultation, 78 institutions, networks, communities and individuals previously contributed to the Ambition Document. The Rolling Agenda was then written by several writing teams, and has the support of partners involved in the NPOS Steering Committee, the Advisory Board and the Rolling Agenda editorial board. This latest version of the Ambition Document and Rolling Agenda has been presented to Minister Dijkgraaf. This marks the end of the National Programme Open Science. With 20 million euros made available annually by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to stimulate our Open Science ambitions, the facilitating role of the NPOS will be passed on to the Regieorgaan Open Science being set up within NWO. An important task of the Regieorgaan will be to enable the plans developed in recent years by providing temporary impulse funding. In addition, the Regieorgaan will play a role in continuing to bring parties, organisations and communities together at various levels, including the national administrative-level consultations on open science. Further elaboration of this will be precipitated in a covenant that will form the basis for the establishment of the Regieorgaan.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":23,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"name":"NPOS","affiliation":[],"nameIdentifiers":[]}]},"referencesRaw":[false,false],"authors":[]}],"authors":[{"id":1020,"createdAt":"2025-10-28T01:50:07.175Z","updatedAt":"2025-11-01T09:02:26.358Z","moduleId":1288,"workspaceId":39,"acceptedInvitation":true,"readyToPublish":false,"authorshipRank":0,"workspace":{"id":39,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T12:40:27.581Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-13T19:50:44.695Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"nsunami","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/f32b045e-382e-4899-a123-9442c1b5e806/","firstName":"Nami","lastName":"Sunami","name":null,"bio":"Research Data Steward ","pronouns":"he/him","url":"https://naoyukiasunami.com/","orcid":"0000-0001-5482-8370"}}],"license":{"id":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.475Z","source":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","name":"CC0 Public Domain Dedication","price":0,"price_id":null,"prod_id":"prod_M0VJdtMgxTMRvS"},"type":{"id":21,"createdAt":"2022-01-31T18:58:51.460Z","originType":"ResearchEquals","wikidata":"Q604733","name":"Presentation","schema":"CreativeWork"},"parents":[],"children":[]}

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is the abstract I submitted to the 2023 edition of the Open Science Conference. Specifically, I propose to talk about the first, second, and third waves of open research. It is a new idea I still have to expand on, so I'd love to hear thoughts if you have them. As of yet, the proposal is still pending but I thought I'd already share it with you ðŸ˜Š</p>

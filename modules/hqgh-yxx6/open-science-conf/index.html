<h2>The third wave of open research</h2>
<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>Open research from four decades ago is not the open research of today. This makes sense as research is ever evolving. But what is a history of open research?</p>
<p>In this talk I will give a historical overview of open research and separate it into three central waves, each as a product of their times. This provides an understanding of how to think about open research as a product of our society, inasmuch as research influences our society.</p>
<p>The first wave of open research spanned several decades. It centered around initiatives like arXiv and PLOS, who focused on access to research as a primary goal. Here, openness was more an end, less a means. Societal concern about open research was low and this principled stance shaped the next waves.</p>
<p>The second wave of open research focused on openness as a means, but a pragmatic means at best. Because of reproducibility issues in the sciences and much news coverage of that fact, openness was centered as a way to improve the rigor of research and trust in research. Research would be better off if it was open, but researchers would not necessarily by better off. Questionable research practices were centered while questionable academic practices remained mostly peripheral.</p>
<p>In the third wave of open research, we see a shift happening: One of openness as a means of social justice. This focus centers working conditions, equity in participation, and governing the commons that openness creates. Questionable academic practices are centered, and as an extension, what accountable and just research means beyond simply accessible and reproducible research.</p>
<p>I will discuss why this third wave is critical to our communal understanding of open research moving forward, how to accelerate openness as a means of social justice, and how intersectional feminism can help us expand our concept of open research.</p>

Starting in social psychology under who later became known as the biggest known psychology fraud, they subsequently focused on meta-research and ways to improve the sustainability of research. They were a Mozilla Open Science Fellow and a Shuttleworth Fellow. In 2019, they founded <a href="https://libscie.org/?ref=chris-hartgerink">Liberate Science GmbH</a> after leaving academia. A mentor called them a &quot;voice of reason&quot; while also being a &quot;system challenger.&quot;</p>

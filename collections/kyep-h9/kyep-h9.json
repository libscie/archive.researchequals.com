We are using a living and prospective approach to Individual-Participant-Data (IPD) meta-analysis of ongoing studies based on the Anytime Live and Leading Interim (ALL-IN) meta-analysis statistical methodology.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>METHODS</jats:title><jats:p>Planned and ongoing randomised controlled trials were identified from trial registries and by snowballing (final elicitation: Oct 3 2022). The methodology was specified prospectively – with no trial results available – for trial inclusion as well as statistical analysis. Inclusion decisions were made collaboratively based on a risk-of-bias assessment by an external protocol review committee (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool adjusted for use on protocols), expected homogeneity in treatment effect, and agreement with the predetermined event definitions. The co-primary endpoints were incidence of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related hospital admission. Accumulating IPD from included trials was analysed sequentially using the exact<jats:italic>e</jats:italic>-value logrank test (at level α = 0.5% for infections and level α = 4.5% for hospitalisations) and anytime-valid 95%-confidence intervals (CIs) for the hazard ratio (HR) for a predetermined fixed-effects approach to meta-analysis (no measures of statistical heterogeneity). Infections were included if demonstrated by PCR tests, antigen tests or suggestive lung CTs. Participants were censored at date of first COVID-19-specific vaccination and two-stage analyses were performed in calendar time, with a stratification factor per trial.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p>Six trials were included in the primary analysis with 4 433 participants in total. The<jats:italic>e</jats:italic>-values showed no evidence of a favourable effect of minimal clinically relevance (HR &lt; 0.8) in comparison to the null (HR = 1) for COVID-19 infections, nor for COVID-19 hospitalisations (HR &lt; 0.7 vs HR = 1). COVID-19 infection was observed in 251 participants receiving BCG and 244 participants not receiving BCG, HR 1.02 (anytime-valid 95%-CI 0.78-1.35). COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in 13 participants receiving BCG and 7 not receiving BCG, resulting in an uninformative estimate (HR 1.88; anytime-valid 95%-CI 0.26-13.40).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>DISCUSSION</jats:title><jats:p>It is highly unlikely that BCG has a clinically relevant effect on COVID-19 infections in healthcare workers. With only limited observations, no conclusion could be drawn for COVID-19 related hospitalisation. Due to the nature of ALL-IN meta-analysis, emerging data from new trials can be included without violating type<jats:italic>-</jats:italic>I error rates or interval coverage. We intend to keep this meta-analysis alive and up-to-date, as more trials report. For COVID-19 related hospitalisations, we do not expect enough future observations for a meaningful analysis. For BCG-mediated protection against COVID-19 infections, on the other hand, more observations could lead to a more precise estimate that concludes the meta-analysis for futility, meaning that the current interval excludes the HR of 0.8 predetermined as effect size of minimal clinical relevance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>OTHER</jats:title><jats:p>No external funding.

several diseases, including childhood virus infections. BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Trial design</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Participants</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiânia - Goiás, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded:</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have had fever in the last fifteen days;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are breastfeeding or pregnant;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are younger than 18 years old;</jats:p>\n<jats:p>- Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Intervention and comparator</jats:title>\n<jats:p>HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> to 8 x10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT.

Climate-related mobility is not inherently a crisis; it can provide a pathway for adaptation to climate change. However, a growing body of research identifies health risks and some opportunities associated with climate-related mobility. This review examines recent research (published since 2018) on the climate change–mobility–health nexus; this research focuses largely on in-country mobility in Asia, Africa, and Pacific Island countries. It considers the links between human mobility and anthropogenic climate change and documents the findings of empirical research that addresses the health consequences of displacement, planned relocation, migration, and migration into sites of climate risk. The findings highlight the need for climate-sensitive and migrant-inclusive health care in a heating world. </jats:p><jats:p> Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 44 is April 2023.

I also discuss the consequences of discrimination against immigrants for immigrants themselves, their families, and the societies in which they settle.

This modern migration entails a material, sensual experience in time. The craft of archaeology has traditionally engaged with the material, the sensual, and the temporal. Archaeologists who study the materiality of modern undocumented migration embrace activist-engaged research that applies the craft of archaeology to the contemporary world. They study the materiality of migration to reveal and comprehend the lived experience of displaced persons. They seek to understand the barriers erected to that journey, the things migrants acquire and leave on the trail, migrant placemaking, their stranded lives, how they build new lives, what the migrants have left behind in their home countries, and the heritage of forced migration. They approach this work in critical solidarity with displaced peoples.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Randall H.","family":"McGuire","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Anthropology, Binghamton University, Binghamton, New York 13902, USA;"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"key":"B1","year":"2019","author":"Agier M","volume-title":"The Jungle: Calais's Camps and Migrants, transl.

This article adopts a critical eye in summarizing current epidemiological knowledge of refugee youth mental health as well as interventions aimed to prevent or reduce mental health problems among children and adolescents in both high- and low-to-middle-income countries. We highlight current challenges and limitations of extant literature and present potential opportunities and recommendations in refugee child psychiatric epidemiology and mental health services research for moving forward. In light of the mounting xenophobic sentiments we are presently witnessing across societies, we argue that, as a first step, all epidemiological and intervention research should advocate for social justice to guarantee the safety of and respect for the basic human rights of all refugee populations during their journey and resettlement. A constructive dialogue between scholars and policy makers is warranted. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Rochelle L.","family":"Frounfelker","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 1A1, Canada;, ,"}]},{"given":"Diana","family":"Miconi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 1A1, Canada;, ,"}]},{"given":"Jordan","family":"Farrar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Research Program on Children and Adversity, School of Social Work, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 02467, USA;,"}]},{"given":"Mohamad Adam","family":"Brooks","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Social Work, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA;"}]},{"given":"Cécile","family":"Rousseau","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 1A1, Canada;, ,"}]},{"given":"Theresa S.","family":"Betancourt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Research Program on Children and Adversity, School of Social Work, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 02467, USA;,"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1080/13623699.2018.1518748","key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1002/rev3.3133","key":"B2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/1359104503008002008","key":"B3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1097/NMD.0000000000000516","key":"B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1093/ije/31.2.285","key":"B5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2014.302504","key":"B6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv9zchv9.11","key":"B7","year":"2019","author":"Betancourt TS","first-page":"137","volume-title":"Humanitarianism and Mass Migration: Confronting the World Crisis","doi-asserted-by":"crossref"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.011","key":"B8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1037/e315362005-001","key":"B9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1542/peds.2007-1648","key":"B10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1007/s10567-010-0081-0","key":"B11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B12","year":"2011","author":"Cavendish B","volume-title":"Children at the border: the screening, protection and repatriation of unaccompanied Mexican minors"},{"DOI":"10.1111/j.1475-3588.2008.00502.x","key":"B13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.chiabu.2012.03.007","key":"B14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1037/cap0000131","key":"B15","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B16","year":"2015","author":"de Ruijter de Wildt L","volume-title":"Reception and living in families: overview of family-based reception for unaccompanied minors in the EU Member States"},{"DOI":"10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.486","key":"B17","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1007/s00787-017-1083-y","key":"B18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/1359104512462549","key":"B19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/1359104505051214","key":"B20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/1359104518758839","key":"B21","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/1363461507081642","key":"B22","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1037/a0029844","key":"B23","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1111/camh.12252","key":"B24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B25","year":"2017","author":"Eurostat","journal-title":"Asylum applicants considered to be unaccompanied minors by citizenship, age and sex.

This review focuses on the role of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugee mental health and includes current knowledge of the prevalence of PTSD, risk factors, and apparent differences that exist between PTSD in refugee populations and PTSD in other populations. An emerging literature on understanding mechanisms of PTSD encompasses neural, cognitive, and social processes, which indicate that these factors may not function exactly as they have functioned previously in other PTSD populations. This review recognizes the numerous debates in the literature on PTSD in refugees, including those on such issues as the conceptualization of mental health and the applicability of the PTSD diagnosis across cultures, as well as the challenge of treating PTSD in low- and-middle-income countries that lack mental health resources to offer standard PTSD treatments. </jats:p><jats:p> Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, Volume 19 is May 2023.

In this paper, we share the advice they had for people who have not yet left their academic position. We found significant themes in the advice we heard from respondents: We heard advice that folks leaving academia need to shift their mindset when thinking about transitioning out of academia. This mindset shift includes reframing the choice to leave as something that is beneficial as well as beginning the process now and not waiting. We also heard a sense of optimism and positivity around leaving academia as well as suggestions around how to reframe one’s career. Folks leaving academia have found a wide variety of practical strategies helpful during their career transition. These include how to explore careers, how to reframe one’s skills, the importance of networking, informational interviews, and to consider the differences in doing job applications outside of academia versus a CV and cover letter inside of academia. Finally, we heard advice on the realities of leaving academia in the form of frank advice around money, value and worth as well as a discussion of the differences between academic work and industry positions. Our hope is that the discussions of the mindset, practical strategies and realities of leaving academia will be inspiring to people looking to gain insights on the choice to leave academia and the honest realities from those who have experienced the shift.

However, getting results published may depend on their statistical significance. The consequence of this is that the representation of scientific knowledge might be biased. This type of bias has been called publication bias. In the present study, we make an attempt to get more insight into publication bias by examining it at the author, reviewer, and editor level. Additionally, we make a direct comparison between publication bias induced by authors, by reviewers, and by editors. Our findings suggest that statistically significant findings have a higher likelihood to be published than statistically non-significant findings, because (1) authors are more likely to write up and submit articles with significant results compared to articles with non-significant results; (2) reviewers give more favourable reviews to articles with significant results compared to articles with non-significant results; and (3) editors are more likely to accept for publication articles with significant results compared to articles with non-significant results.

Air travel and attendance to conferences concentrate recent data and debates. Here we develop a hybrid method to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to research purchases. To do so, we combine macroeconomic databases, research-centered companies footprints and life-cycle analysis to construct a public database of monetary emission factors (EF) for research purchases. We apply such EFs to estimate the purchases emissions of a hundred of research laboratories in France, belonging to the Labos 1point5 network and gathering more than 20000 staff, from all disciplines. We find that purchases dominate laboratory emissions, with a median of 2.3 tCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e/pers, accounting for more than 50% of emissions, and 3-fold higher than the separate contribution from travel, commutes and heating. Electricity emissions are 5-fold lower in our dataset of laboratories using low carbon electricity but they become preponderant for high carbon electricity mixes (3.5 tCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e/pers). Purchases emissions are very heterogeneous among laboratories, but are strongly correlated with budget, with an average carbon intensity of 0.33<jats:italic>±</jats:italic>0.07 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e/€ and differences between research domains. Finally, we quantify the effect of a series of demand-driven mitigation strategies obtaining a maximum reduction of 20 % in total emissions (−40 % in purchases emissions), suggesting that effectively reducing the carbon footprint of research activities calls for systemic changes.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":451,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Marianne","family":"De Paepe","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Laurent","family":"Jeanneau","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jerôme","family":"Mariette","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Olivier","family":"Aumont","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"André","family":"Estevez-Torres","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1126/science.1259855","key":"2023041802151831000_2023.04.04.535626v2.1","unstructured":"Steffen, W. et al.

Here, we conducted a study to explore possible reasons for this discrepancy.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sec002\">\n<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an online survey assessing attitudes, motivations, and perceived obstacles with respect to preregistration. Respondents (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 289) were psychological researchers that were recruited through their publications on Web of Science, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and PsycInfo, and preregistrations on OSF Registries. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we predicted that positive attitudes (moderated by the perceived importance of preregistration) as well as a favorable subjective norm and higher perceived behavioral control positively influence researchers’ intention to preregister (directional hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we expected an influence of research experience on attitudes and perceived motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration (non-directional hypothesis 2). We analyzed these hypotheses with multiple regression models and included preregistration experience as a control variable.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sec003\">\n<jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Researchers’ attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and the perceived importance of preregistration significantly predicted researchers’ intention to use preregistration in the future (see hypothesis 1). Research experience influenced both researchers’ attitudes and their perception of motivations to preregister, but not the perception of obstacles (see hypothesis 2). Descriptive reports on researchers’ attitudes, motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration are provided.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sec004\">\n<jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Many researchers had already preregistered and had a rather positive attitude toward preregistration. Nevertheless, several obstacles were identified that may be addressed to improve and foster preregistration.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>","language":"en","licenseId":49,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4925-7291","given":"Lisa","family":"Spitzer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Stefanie","family":"Mueller","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124","key":"pone.0281086.ref001","year":"2005","author":"JPA Ioannidis","volume":"2","first-page":"e124","article-title":"Why most published research findings are false","journal-title":"PLoS Med","doi-asserted-by":"crossref"},{"DOI":"10.1126/science.aac4716","key":"pone.0281086.ref002","year":"2015","author":"Open Science Collaboration","volume":"349","first-page":"aac4716","article-title":"Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science","journal-title":"Science","doi-asserted-by":"crossref"},{"DOI":"10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011845","key":"pone.0281086.ref003","year":"2018","author":"PE Shrout","volume":"69","first-page":"487","article-title":"Psychology, Science, and Knowledge Construction: Broadening Perspectives from the Replication Crisis","journal-title":"Annu Rev Psychol","doi-asserted-by":"crossref"},{"DOI":"10.1038/s41562-021-01269-4","key":"pone.0281086.ref004","year":"2022","issue":"3","author":"S Parsons","volume":"6","first-page":"312","article-title":"A community-sourced glossary of open scholarship terms","journal-title":"Nat Hum Behav","doi-asserted-by":"crossref"},{"DOI":"10.1038/533452a","key":"pone.0281086.ref005","year":"2016","author":"M.

The current position paper provides a broad perspective on this scientific error, focusing both on reform history and on opportunities for future reform. Talking points are organised along four main themes: methodological reform, statistical reform, publishing reform, and institutional reform. For each of these four themes, we discuss the current state of affairs, existing knowledge gaps, and opportunities for future reform. The resulting agenda should provide a useful resource for ushering in an era that is marked by a lower prevalence of scientific error.</p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":451,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5030-4091","given":"Don","family":"van Ravenzwaaij","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Marjan","family":"Bakker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3823-944X","given":"Remco","family":"Heesen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0858-7243","given":"Felipe","family":"Romero","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Noah N'Djaye Nikolai","family":"van Dongen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4178-5820","given":"Sophia","family":"Crüwell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7874-1261","given":"Sarahanne","family":"Field","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Chris Hubertus Joseph","family":"Hartgerink","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8686-5325","given":"Leonhard","family":"Held","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4049-993X","given":"Marcus Robert","family":"Munafo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7487-7898","given":"Merle-Marie","family":"Pittelkow","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7333-0383","given":"Leonid","family":"Tiokhin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"given":"Vincent","family":"Traag","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0712-3746","given":"Olmo","family":"Van den Akker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2733-1841","given":"Anna Elisabeth","family":"van 't Veer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1596-1034","given":"Eric-Jan","family":"Wagenmakers","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true}]},"referencesRaw":{}},"editor":{"id":4,"createdAt":"2022-09-24T05:11:44.354Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-24T05:11:44.355Z","role":"OWNER","isActive":true,"collectionId":5,"workspaceId":4,"workspace":{"id":4,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T07:55:58.291Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-20T12:11:31.494Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"chartgerink","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/c78895d5-bc4b-4aaf-9cb5-54bccbf8730e/-/crop/405x405/62,0/-/preview/","firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Hartgerink","name":null,"bio":"My research focuses on how the publishing system can facilitate improved quality of scholarly research.

They have discovered that much of the literature body is unreliable and possibly invalid thanks to weak theory, flawed methods, and shoddy statistics. This is driven by a widespread competitive, secretive approach to research, which, in turn, is fueled by toxic academic incentive structures. Many in the community have decided to address these issues, coming together in what has become known as the ‘scientific reform movement’. While these ‘reformers’ are often spoken of a single, homogeneous entity, my findings underscore the heterogeneity of the reform community. In my dissertation, I explore the scientific reform group using ethnography and social network analysis tools. I primarily studied their online Twitter engagements to understand their culture, practices, and structure. With Wenger’s Community of Practice theory as an interpretive framework, I analyze scientific reform discourse playing out between reformers on Twitter. Using quantitative Twitter friend/follow data, I investigate which reform members engage online, using following behavior to understand aspects of their social structure. I link the quantitative exploration with my qualitative analysis, to conclude that while the reformers are united by their interest in improving science, they are better characterized as a constellation of small communities of practice, each with their own norms, priorities, and unique approach to the group enterprise of scientific reform. My investigation is an exercise in reflexivity as I have studied a community in which I am an active part.</p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":451,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Sarahanne Miranda","family":"Field","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{}},"editor":{"id":4,"createdAt":"2022-09-24T05:11:44.354Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-24T05:11:44.355Z","role":"OWNER","isActive":true,"collectionId":5,"workspaceId":4,"workspace":{"id":4,"createdAt":"2022-02-01T07:55:58.291Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-20T12:11:31.494Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"chartgerink","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/c78895d5-bc4b-4aaf-9cb5-54bccbf8730e/-/crop/405x405/62,0/-/preview/","firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Hartgerink","name":null,"bio":"My research focuses on how the publishing system can facilitate improved quality of scholarly research.

This article synthesizes a breadth of conservation conflict literature to lay out a transdisciplinary framework for diagnosing complex conservation conflicts composed of six key aspects: complexity, emergence, and stages; conflict status; basis of contention and cognitive framing; state of knowledge; state of values; and interventions. This framework is based in systems thinking and encourages users to harness thinking based in storytelling and consider how a conservation conflict represents a larger ongoing narrative with depth, meaning, and containing complex, interrelated storylines.\n\nThis paper was authored by Hannah L.

Yet, many local-level stakeholder groups, such as anglers, continue to support the use of hatcheries as a means of conserving declining wild fish stocks, particularly for Atlantic salmon. Could it be that their interest and support of hatcheries is about more than the fish they produce?

The opening of this fishery happened in tandem with the removal of a “stock of yield concern” status for Susitna River sockeye and additional restrictions for the Cook Inlet drift fishing fleet in order to minimize intercept of salmon bound for the Susitna River drainage. Given the long history of inter-gear group conflicts in this area, these changes are likely to have social and, perhaps, ecological impacts on the salmon stocks and user groups of Cook Inlet fisheries. This article uses scenario development to offer four possible scenarios organized around the potential popularity of the new fishery, and the potential demand for harvestable abundance. These scenarios are intended to give all involved stakeholders an opportunity to understand the landscapes opened up by the new personal use fishery, and the potential winners and losers of each. By drawing from social-ecological coexistence theory, this study also gives thought to how the equity between user groups (inclusive of the environment) may be affected in each scenario, considers the impacts of politicized fisheries management on power dynamics within the region, and discusses how least equitable scenarios might be improved using equalizing mechanisms.\n\nThis paper was authored by Hannah L.

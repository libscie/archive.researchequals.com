As with the early internet, scholarly organizations are at the forefront of developing and implementing a decentralized alternative to Twitter, Mastodon. Both historically and conceptually, this is not a new situation for the scholarly community. Historically, scholars were forced to leave social media platform FriendFeed after it was bought by Facebook in 2006. Conceptually, the problems associated with public scholarly discourse subjected to the whims of corporate owners are not unlike those of scholarly journals owned by monopolistic corporations: in both cases the perils associated with a public good in private hands are palpable. For both short form (Twitter/Mastodon) and longer form (journals) scholarly discourse, decentralized solutions exist, some of which are already enjoying some institutional support. Here we argue that scholarly organizations, in particular learned societies, are now facing a golden opportunity to rethink their hesitations towards such alternatives and support the migration of the scholarly community from Twitter to Mastodon by hosting Mastodon instances. Demonstrating that the scholarly community is capable of creating a truly public square for scholarly discourse, impervious to private takeover, might renew confidence and inspire the community to focus on analogous solutions for the remaining scholarly record – encompassing text, data and code – to safeguard all publicly owned scholarly knowledge.","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":23,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"name":"Brembs, Björn","nameType":"Personal","givenName":"Björn","familyName":"Brembs","affiliation":["Universität Regensburg"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":"https://orcid.org","nameIdentifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7824-7650","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]},{"name":"Lenardic, Adrian","nameType":"Personal","givenName":"Adrian","familyName":"Lenardic","affiliation":["Rice University"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":"https://orcid.org","nameIdentifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5541-9576","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]},{"name":"Murray-Rust, Peter","nameType":"Personal","givenName":"Peter","familyName":"Murray-Rust","affiliation":["University of Cambridge"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":"https://orcid.org","nameIdentifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3386-3972","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]},{"name":"Chan, Leslie","nameType":"Personal","givenName":"Leslie","familyName":"Chan","affiliation":["University of Toronto Scarborough"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":"https://orcid.org","nameIdentifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7779-2059","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]},{"name":"Irawan, Dasapta Erwin","nameType":"Personal","givenName":"Dasapta Erwin","familyName":"Irawan","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Bandung"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"schemeUri":"https://orcid.org","nameIdentifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1526-0863","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]}]},"referencesRaw":[false,false]},"editor":{"id":31,"createdAt":"2023-02-23T17:33:30.845Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-23T17:33:30.845Z","role":"USER","isActive":true,"collectionId":20,"workspaceId":309,"workspace":{"id":309,"createdAt":"2023-02-03T23:09:53.487Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-03T23:29:37.514Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"vinodhilangovan","avatar":"https://eu.ui-avatars.com/api/?rounded=true&background=574cfa&color=ffffff&name=vinodhilangovan","firstName":"Vinodh","lastName":"Ilangovan","name":null,"bio":"A star-dust with consciousness promoting anti-kyriarchy.  \nCoordinator for curation of the Open Research Knowledge Graph at Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology (TIB), Hannover, Germany.

Natural sciences have traditionally been disseminated in outreach activities as formal, one-way presentations. Nevertheless, innovative strategies are being increasingly developed using arts, gaming, and sketching, amongst others. This work aimed at testing an alternative and innovative way to engage non-expert audiences in ocean and coastal geology through a combination of scientific concept explanations and creative dancing. An informal education activity focusing on ocean dynamics was designed for 10-year-old students. It combines coastal science concepts (wind, waves, currents, and sand), storytelling techniques (narrative arc), and creative dance techniques (movement, imaginative play, and sensory engagement). A sequence of six exercises was proposed, starting with the generation of offshore ocean waves and ending with sediment transport on the beach during storm/fair-weather conditions. Scientific concepts were then translated into structured creative movements, within imaginary scenarios, and accompanied by sounds or music. The activity was performed six times with a total of 112 students. It was an inclusive activity given that all students in the class participated, including children with several mild types of cognitive and neurological impairment. The science and art activity aroused emotions of enjoyment and pleasure and allowed for effective communication between scientists and school community. Moreover, the results provide evidence of the activity's effectiveness in engaging children and developing their willingness to further participate in similar activities.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2090-6291","given":"Ana","family":"Matias","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8980-0068","given":"A.

Do non-human animals learn to associate human speech with specific objects in everyday life? We examined whether cats matched familiar cats’ names and faces (Exp.1) and human family members’ names and faces (Exp.2). Cats were presented with a photo of the familiar cat’s face on a laptop monitor after hearing the same cat’s name or another cat’s name called by the subject cat’s owner (Exp.1) or an experimenter (Exp.2). Half of the trials were in a congruent condition where the name and face matched, and half were in an incongruent (mismatch) condition. Results of Exp.1 showed that household cats paid attention to the monitor for longer in the incongruent condition, suggesting an expectancy violation effect; however, café cats did not. In Exp.2, cats living in larger human families were found to look at the monitor for increasingly longer durations in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, this tendency was stronger among cats that had lived with their human family for a longer time, although we could not rule out an effect of age. This study provides evidence that cats link a companion's name and corresponding face without explicit training.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":381,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Saho","family":"Takagi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Atsuko","family":"Saito","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Minori","family":"Arahori","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hitomi","family":"Chijiiwa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hikari","family":"Koyasu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Miho","family":"Nagasawa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Takefumi","family":"Kikusui","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kazuo","family":"Fujita","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hika","family":"Kuroshima","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"key":"10261_CR1","unstructured":"Hurford, J.

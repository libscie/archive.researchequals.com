with Impact: Building Confidence and Mastering Negotiation in Open Science","description":"Success in academia and open science is not just about groundbreaking research—it’s about advocating for your work, negotiating effectively, and communicating with confidence.\n\nYet, many Ph.D.s and open science researchers struggle with self-doubt, imposter syndrome, or hesitancy to assert their ideas, especially in competitive or collaborative settings.\n\nThis workshop, led by executive coach Jamie Lee, equips researchers with the tools to confidently advocate for themselves, their ideas, and their contributions.\n\nDrawing on evidence-based practical neuroscience and proven negotiation strategies, participants will learn to overcome the internal and external barriers that hinder self-advocacy.\n\nWhether negotiating resources, pitching a project, or navigating interdisciplinary collaborations, this session will empower attendees to show up as credible and impactful leaders.\n\nThrough interactive exercises and real-world examples tailored to the open science community, participants will:\n\nReframe unhelpful thought patterns and shift from self-doubt to self-assurance in minutes.\nLearn the fundamentals of negotiating effectively while preserving relationships.\nDevelop practical self-advocacy strategies for meetings, presentations, and collaborations.\nBuild confidence to navigate conflict and communicate with authority in challenging conversations.\nCreate a personalized toolkit for asserting their value and ensuring their voice is heard.\nJamie Lee, an executive coach specializing in self-advocacy and leadership, has helped professionals in high-stakes environments amplify their voices, lead with clarity, and achieve career-defining results.

student assignments that advance open and reproducible science","description":"<p>Since the replication crisis came to widespread attention in psychology, there has beensignificant progress in reforming research practices to be more open and reproducible.However, the integration of these principles into teaching—particularly assessment—haslagged behind. While many open educational resources (OERs) have been developed tosupport the teaching of open science, fewer efforts have focused on embedding openscience into how students are assessed. This tutorial addresses that gap by offering a seriesof practical, scalable strategies for integrating open and reproducible science intopsychology education through assessment. We argue that to normalise open science,students must not only learn about its principles but be assessed on their understanding andapplication of them. Drawing on examples from our undergraduate and postgraduateprogrammes and the wider literature, we outline a range of assessment strategies alignedwith curriculum standards and pedagogical evidence. These include incorporatingpre-registration and registered reports, evaluating reproducibility through code and datasubmission, engaging students in peer review and code review, and integrating openscience concepts into essays, multiple-choice exams, and final dissertations. We highlightthat even small changes at the course level can promote open science, and that educatorsshould approach implementation flexibly, recognising it as a continuum rather than a binaryshift. Importantly, we also stress the need to avoid framing open science as overly technicalor inaccessible, which may discourage student engagement. By embedding open andreproducible practices into assessment design, educators can support the development ofcritical, ethical, and transparent future scientists. While the examples provided are drawnfrom psychology, the strategies are applicable to a wide range of data-driven disciplines.</p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":451,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"James Edward","family":"Bartlett","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gaby","family":"Mahrholz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0806-1081","given":"Emily","family":"Nordmann","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"authenticated-orcid":true}]},"referencesRaw":{}},"editor":{"id":63,"createdAt":"2025-04-15T10:16:13.710Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-15T10:16:13.710Z","role":"OWNER","isActive":true,"collectionId":54,"workspaceId":543,"workspace":{"id":543,"createdAt":"2024-04-12T16:13:43.847Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-16T07:28:21.940Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"joyceykao","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/1fc94ec8-26ba-47d0-a277-9b1876cec62e/-/crop/415x415/0,45/-/preview/","firstName":"Joyce","lastName":"Kao","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":"she/her","url":"https://www.jykao.com","orcid":"0000-0003-2082-6937"}}},{"id":236,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T15:07:31.411Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-22T09:50:00.115Z","accepted":true,"collectionId":54,"moduleId":1132,"comment":null,"editorshipId":63,"workspaceId":662,"pinPosition":null,"submittedBy":{"id":662,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T10:43:48.706Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T15:08:09.602Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"lydiariedl","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/b508e255-29a1-4bf1-a38c-231dd82893d4/-/crop/443x443/0,11/-/preview/","firstName":"Lydia","lastName":"Riedl","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":null,"orcid":"0000-0003-4131-7891"},"module":{"id":1132,"createdAt":"2025-04-17T14:52:31.934Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-17T15:06:50.313Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2025-04-17T15:06:49.000Z","publishedWhere":"ResearchEquals","originMetadata":"ResearchEquals","url":"https://doi.org/10.53962/qjqf-4ddg","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.53962","suffix":"qjqf-4ddg","title":"Empowering new roles in digital research","description":"As research increasingly relies on digital expertise, institutions must establish sustainable support structures for emerging roles such as Research Software Engineers, Data Stewards, Data Scientists, and eScientists.

with Impact: Building Confidence and Mastering Negotiation in Open Science","description":"Success in academia and open science is not just about groundbreaking research—it’s about advocating for your work, negotiating effectively, and communicating with confidence.\n\nYet, many Ph.D.s and open science researchers struggle with self-doubt, imposter syndrome, or hesitancy to assert their ideas, especially in competitive or collaborative settings.\n\nThis workshop, led by executive coach Jamie Lee, equips researchers with the tools to confidently advocate for themselves, their ideas, and their contributions.\n\nDrawing on evidence-based practical neuroscience and proven negotiation strategies, participants will learn to overcome the internal and external barriers that hinder self-advocacy.\n\nWhether negotiating resources, pitching a project, or navigating interdisciplinary collaborations, this session will empower attendees to show up as credible and impactful leaders.\n\nThrough interactive exercises and real-world examples tailored to the open science community, participants will:\n\n\n\nReframe unhelpful thought patterns and shift from self-doubt to self-assurance in minutes.\n\nLearn the fundamentals of negotiating effectively while preserving relationships.\n\nDevelop practical self-advocacy strategies for meetings, presentations, and collaborations.\n\nBuild confidence to navigate conflict and communicate with authority in challenging conversations.\n\nCreate a personalized toolkit for asserting their value and ensuring their voice is heard.\n\n\nJamie Lee, an executive coach specializing in self-advocacy and leadership, has helped professionals in high-stakes environments amplify their voices, lead with clarity, and achieve career-defining results.

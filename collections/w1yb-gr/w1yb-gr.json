I study the science reform movement, analysing aspects of community formation and behaviour. I am a postdoctoral researcher at CWTS, Leiden University. In that capacity I am working to establish a cross-disciplinary definition of responsible research along with a community of practice that embeds the practical aspects of that definition. I advocate reflexivity in science, and argue that reform must involve the anticipation of the downstream effects of its practices if it is to be successful in the long run. Also, mixed methods is where its at.","pronouns":"she/her","url":"http://www.sarahannemfield.eu","orcid":"0000-0001-7874-1261","members":[{"id":119,"role":"OWNER","workspaceId":120,"userId":120,"invitedName":null,"invitedEmail":null,"emailInvitations":true,"emailApprovals":true,"emailWeeklyDigest":true,"emailCollections":true,"user":{"id":120}}]}}],"type":{"id":1,"createdAt":"2022-09-23T13:58:50.823Z","updatedAt":"2023-09-07T15:30:09.356Z","type":"INDIVIDUAL","price":0,"price_id":null}}

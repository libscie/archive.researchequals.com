PubCasts aim to make scholarly work more accessible, engaging, and easily understood by broad audiences. We highlight our motivation for creating PubCasts and discuss our experiences in making and sharing them. We further reflect on the potential of PubCasts to combat misinformation by offering a more intimate and humanized form of science communication. To assist others in adopting PubCasting, we explain the process of creating PubCasts, including required components and hosting options, and conclude with encouragement to other science communicators. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1411-4039","given":"Hannah L.","family":"Harrison","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Marine Affairs Program, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"}],"authenticated-orcid":false},{"given":"Philip A.","family":"Loring","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Geography, Environment, and Geomatics, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1177/0162243906287547","key":"bibr1-10755470231186397","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1007/s10670-021-00485-8","key":"bibr2-10755470231186397","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.51644/9781777948801","key":"bibr3-10755470231186397","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.3389/fcomm.2023.1090112","key":"bibr4-10755470231186397","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1080/03075079.2020.1859681","key":"bibr5-10755470231186397","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"bibr6-10755470231186397","year":"2017","issue":"1","author":"Funk C.","volume":"34","first-page":"86","journal-title":"Issues in Science and Technology"},{"DOI":"10.1002/nafm.10830","key":"bibr7-10755470231186397","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.53962/hzk8-8ytf","key":"bibr8-10755470231186397","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"bibr9-10755470231186397","unstructured":"Harrison H.

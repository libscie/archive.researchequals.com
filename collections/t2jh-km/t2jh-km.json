How exactly are misinformation proliferation and health disparities related, however? What roles might misinformation play in explaining the health disparities that we have documented in the United States and elsewhere? How might we mitigate the effects of misinformation exposure among people facing relatively poor health outcomes? In this review, we address such questions by first defining health disparities and misinformation as concepts and then considering how misinformation exposure might theoretically affect health decision-making and account for disparate health behavior and health outcomes. We also assess the potential for misinformation-focused interventions to address health disparities based on available literature and call for future research to address gaps in our current evidence base. </jats:p><jats:p> Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 44 is April 2023.

However, given the large amount of inaccurate information online, people can easily become misinformed. Individuals have always obtained information from outside the formal health care system, so how has the internet changed people's engagement with health information? This review explores how individuals interact with health misinformation online, whether it be through search, user-generated content, or mobile apps. We discuss whether personal access to information is helping or hindering health outcomes and how the perceived trustworthiness of the institutions communicating health has changed over time. To conclude, we propose several constructive strategies for improving the online information ecosystem. Misinformation concerning health has particularly severe consequences with regard to people's quality of life and even their risk of mortality; therefore, understanding it within today's modern context is an extremely important task.</jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Briony","family":"Swire-Thompson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Network Science Institute, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;,"},{"name":"Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA"}]},{"given":"David","family":"Lazer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Network Science Institute, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA;,"},{"name":"Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1016/j.amepre.2010.10.032","key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1098/rsos.180593","key":"B2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.4236/ce.2015.64045","key":"B3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/074391568300200102","key":"B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024791","key":"B5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B6","year":"2018","author":"ASCO (Am.

However, a substantial amount of the physical activity occurring routinely in many settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is the result of economic necessity and is not due to true, free choices. We propose the “necessity- versus choice-based physical activity models” framework as a conceptual tool to ground physical activity and public health research and promotion efforts in LMICs, helping ensure that these efforts are relevant, ethical, responsive, and respectful to local contexts. Identifying ways to ensure that LMIC populations can maintain high levels of active transport while increasing opportunities for active leisure must be prioritized. To promote equity, physical activity research, programs, and policies in LMICs must focus on improving the conditions under which necessity-driven physical activity occurs for a vast majority of the population. </jats:p><jats:p> Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 44 is April 2023.

Mobile technology—and the unprecedented scope and quantity of data it generates—has a promising but largely untapped potential to promote health behaviors at the individual and population levels. This perspective article provides multidisciplinary recommendations on the design and use of mobile technology, and the concomitant wealth of data, to promote behaviors that support overall health. Using physical activity as an exemplar health behavior, we review emerging strategies for health behavior change interventions. We describe progress on personalizing interventions to an individual and their social, cultural, and built environments, as well as on evaluating relationships between mobile technology data and health to establish evidence-based guidelines. In reviewing these strategies and highlighting directions for future research, we advance the use of theory-based, personalized, and human-centered approaches in promoting health behaviors. </jats:p><jats:p> Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 44 is April 2023.

Risks are highest during extreme heat events (EHEs), which challenge the capacity of health systems and other critical infrastructure. EHEs are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is driving an increasing proportion of heat-related mortality, necessitating more investment in health protection. Climate-resilient health systems are better positioned for EHEs, and EHE preparedness is a form of disaster risk reduction. Preparedness activities commonly take the form of heat action plans (HAPs), with many examples at various administrative scales. HAP activities can be divided into primary prevention, most important in the pre-event phase; secondary prevention, key to risk reduction early in an EHE; and tertiary prevention, important later in the event phase. After-action reports and other postevent evaluation activities are central to adaptive management of this climate-sensitive hazard. </jats:p><jats:p> Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 44 is April 2023.

We address connections between air pollution and ( a) rapid urbanization, ( b) social problems, ( c) health impacts, ( d) climate change, ( e) policies, and ( f) new innovations. We acknowledge that air pollution levels in Africa can be extremely high and a serious health threat. The toxic content of the pollution could relate to region-specific sources such as low standards for vehicles and fuels, cooking with solid fuels, and burning household waste. We implore the pursuit of interdisciplinary research to create new approaches with relevant stakeholders. Moreover, successful air pollution research must regard conflicts, tensions, and synergies inherent to development processes in African municipalities, regions, and countries. This includes global relationships regarding climate change, trade, urban planning, and transportation. Incorporating aspects of local political situations (e.g., democracy) can also enhance greater political accountability and awareness about air pollution. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Asmamaw","family":"Abera","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Public Health, Addis Ababa University, 9086 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}]},{"given":"Johan","family":"Friberg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Nuclear Physics, Faculty of Engineering, Lund University, 223 63 Lund, Sweden"}]},{"given":"Christina","family":"Isaxon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Ergonomics and Aerosol Technology, Department of Design Sciences, Lund University, 223 62 Lund, Sweden;"}]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Jerrett","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California Los Angeles, California 90095, USA"}]},{"given":"Ebba","family":"Malmqvist","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Lund University, 221 00 Lund, Sweden;"}]},{"given":"Cheryl","family":"Sjöström","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Environmental and Climate Science, Lund University, 221 00 Lund, Sweden"}]},{"given":"Tahir","family":"Taj","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Lund University, 221 00 Lund, Sweden"}]},{"given":"Ana Maria","family":"Vargas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"International Center for Local Democracy, 621 22 Visby, Sweden"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"key":"B1","year":"2018","author":"Abramowitz MJ.","journal-title":"Freedom in the World 2018: Democracy in Crisis"},{"key":"B2","year":"2018","author":"ADB (Afr.

Our focus is predominantly on the value of and concerns with regard to the application of digital health within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is in LMICs and marginalized communities that mHealth (within the wider scope of digital health) could be most useful and valuable. Peer-reviewed literature on mHealth in LMICs provides reassurance of this potential, often reflecting on the ubiquity of mobile phones and ever-increasing connectivity globally, reaching remote or otherwise disengaged populations. Efforts to adapt successful programs for LMIC contexts and populations are only just starting to reap rewards. Private-sector investment in mHealth offers value through enhanced capacity and advances in technology as well as the ability to meet increasing consumer demand for real-time, accessible, convenient, and choice-driven health care options. We examine some of the potential considerations associated with a private-sector investment, questioning whether a core of transparency, local ownership, equity, and safety is likely to be upheld in the current environment of health entrepreneurship. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Judith","family":"McCool","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Population Health, Faculty of Medical and Health Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand;"}]},{"given":"Rosie","family":"Dobson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"National Institute for Health Innovation, School of Population Health, Faculty of Medical and Health Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"}]},{"given":"Robyn","family":"Whittaker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"National Institute for Health Innovation, School of Population Health, Faculty of Medical and Health Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"},{"name":"i3 Institute for Innovation and Improvement, Waitemata District Health Board, North Shore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand"}]},{"given":"Chris","family":"Paton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"name":"Department of Information Science, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1186/s12889-017-4973-5","key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1007/s42600-021-00154-3","key":"B2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.9745/GHSP-D-15-00393","key":"B3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1136/bmj.i1174","key":"B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1111/tmi.12525","key":"B5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000543","key":"B6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/0141076812472620","key":"B7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1186/1744-8603-10-49","key":"B8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2196/mhealth.7291","key":"B9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30191-0","key":"B10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01102-8","key":"B11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/2047487315613462","key":"B12","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30874-7","key":"B13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2196/15466","key":"B14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B15","year":"2021","author":"Downey A.","journal-title":"Private Equity Insider"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2016.03.472","key":"B16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1186/1471-2393-12-15","key":"B17","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B18","year":"2020","author":"Glaser J.","journal-title":"Harvard Business Review"},{"DOI":"10.17269/s41997-021-00487-7","key":"B19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B20","year":"2020","author":"GSMA","volume-title":"The Mobile Economy, Asia Pacific 2020"},{"DOI":"10.1007/s10198-012-0424-5","key":"B21","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B22","year":"2012","issue":"3","author":"Horvath T","volume":"2012","first-page":"CD009756","journal-title":"Cochrane Database Syst.

These challenges are especially pressing in cities, where social-ecological interactions are pronounced. The One Health concept provides an organizing framework that promotes the health and well-being of urban communities and ecosystems. However, for One Health to be successful, it must incorporate societal inequities in environmental disamenities, exposures, and policy. Such inequities affect all One Health interfaces, including the distribution of ecosystem services and disservices, the nature and frequency ofhuman–wildlife interactions, and legacies of land use. Here, we review the current literature on One Health perspectives, pinpoint areas in which to incorporate an environmental justice lens, and close with recommendations for future work. Intensifying social, political, and environmental unrest underscores a dire need for One Health solutions informed by environmental justice principles to help build healthier, more resilient cities. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Maureen H.","family":"Murray","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Conservation and Science, Urban Wildlife Institute, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, Illinois, USA;"}]},{"given":"Jacqueline","family":"Buckley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Conservation and Science, Urban Wildlife Institute, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, Illinois, USA;"}]},{"given":"Kaylee A.","family":"Byers","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"name":"Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada"}]},{"given":"Kimberly","family":"Fake","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Conservation and Science, Urban Wildlife Institute, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, Illinois, USA;"}]},{"given":"Elizabeth W.","family":"Lehrer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Conservation and Science, Urban Wildlife Institute, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, Illinois, USA;"}]},{"given":"Seth B.","family":"Magle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Conservation and Science, Urban Wildlife Institute, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, Illinois, USA;"}]},{"given":"Christopher","family":"Stone","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Illinois Natural History Survey, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Champaign, Illinois, USA"}]},{"given":"Holly","family":"Tuten","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Illinois Natural History Survey, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Champaign, Illinois, USA"}]},{"given":"Christopher J.","family":"Schell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA;"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2011.300119","key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30085-2","key":"B2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[1169:IHIEOA]2.0.CO;2","key":"B3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01260.x","key":"B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/0885412215610491","key":"B5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1007/82_2012_223","key":"B6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1177/0956247814522154","key":"B7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2112/04-0212.1","key":"B8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.ttbdis.2013.01.001","key":"B9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B10","year":"2021","author":"BC Coroners Service","journal-title":"BC Gov News"},{"DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01736.x","key":"B11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.tree.2006.11.001","key":"B12","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.aax0903","key":"B13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2011.300232","key":"B14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9","key":"B15","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1007/s10980-009-9402-4","key":"B16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1111/nyas.13950","key":"B17","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S0398-7620(06)76706-2","key":"B18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1111/geb.13122","key":"B19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1111/gcb.14682","key":"B20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1289/ehp.117-a20","key":"B21","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1038/s41562-020-0917-7","key":"B22","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1111/gcb.16033","key":"B23","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.5751/ES-01569-110114","key":"B24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2016.0167","key":"B25","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031914-122646","key":"B26","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1126/science.287.5452.443","key":"B27","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30179-0","key":"B28","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.07.006","key":"B29","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1029/2021GL094333","key":"B30","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31371-4","key":"B31","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2190/HS.42.4.c","key":"B32","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1093/icb/icy101","key":"B33","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1186/1471-2458-5-119","key":"B35","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B34","year":"2022","author":"Environ.

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm's way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth's energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now. </jats:p>","language":"en","licenseId":null,"moduleTypeId":169,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"given":"Kristie L.","family":"Ebi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Health and the Global Environment, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA;"}]},{"given":"Jennifer","family":"Vanos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA"}]},{"given":"Jane W.","family":"Baldwin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, New York 10964, USA"}]},{"given":"Jesse E.","family":"Bell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Environmental, Agricultural, and Occupational Health, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198, USA"}]},{"given":"David M.","family":"Hondula","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Geographical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA"}]},{"given":"Nicole A.","family":"Errett","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA"}]},{"given":"Katie","family":"Hayes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 2S2, Canada"}]},{"given":"Colleen E.","family":"Reid","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Geography Department, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309, USA"}]},{"given":"Shubhayu","family":"Saha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA"}]},{"given":"June","family":"Spector","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA"},{"name":"Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA"}]},{"given":"Peter","family":"Berry","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Environment, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada"}]}]},"referencesRaw":{"object":[{"DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1607171113","key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.3390/ijerph16193720","key":"B2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1080/10398560701701288","key":"B3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1097/EDE.0b013e31828ac01b","key":"B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1289/EHP6976","key":"B4a","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B5","year":"2009","author":"Anderson WA.","volume-title":"Disaster Risk Management in an Age of Climate Change: A Summary of the April 3, 2008 Workshop of the Disasters Roundtable"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.ergon.2008.01.017","key":"B6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1029/2018EF000989","key":"B7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.3390/ijerph15040793","key":"B8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1175/WCAS-D-16-0033.1","key":"B9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/S2542-5196(17)30002-5","key":"B10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1038/s41893-019-0441-9","key":"B11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1289/ehp.1307392","key":"B12","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.07.007","key":"B13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20","key":"B14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.envres.2019.108777","key":"B15","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1186/s12888-018-2007-1","key":"B16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1038/s41558-018-0222-x","key":"B17","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.4085/1062-6050-50.9.07","key":"B18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.3390/ijerph16152657","key":"B19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.086","key":"B20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.5811/westjem.2020.1.41055","key":"B21","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.3390/ijerph15040754","key":"B22","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.2165/00002018-200831020-00002","key":"B23","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B24","year":"2017","author":"Clayton S","volume-title":"Mental health and our changing climate: impacts, implications, and guidance"},{"DOI":"10.1002/2016GH000033","key":"B25","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.1152/japplphysiol.00786.2019","key":"B26","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"key":"B27","year":"2015","author":"CRED (Cent.

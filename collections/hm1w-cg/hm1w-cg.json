March 2025","description":"<p>Welcome to the collection of outputs from the Snakemake Hackathon, held in Geneva from March 10-14, 2025. Forty participants – developers, researchers, and enthusiasts – came together to advance the Snakemake workflow management system through focused, collaborative work. Projects spanned a wide range of improvements, from laying out the Snakemake workflow collection to overhauling core components and developing new plugins. This collection showcases the tangible results of that week: ideas documented, projects started, and contributions shared. You’ll find resources published directly on ResearchEquals, and potentially linked to other platforms via DOI. We hope this collection inspires further development and adoption of Snakemake.</p><p><br></p><p><em>This hackathon was supported by the National Science Foundation under awards OAC-2226378, OAC-2226379, and OAC-2226380</em></p>","language":"en","submissions":[{"id":243,"createdAt":"2025-05-07T20:14:32.057Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-07T20:15:52.184Z","accepted":true,"collectionId":55,"moduleId":1150,"comment":"As of v1.0.0 of the plugin, using GPUs is facilitated by the Snakemake Executor Plugin for SLURM ","editorshipId":70,"workspaceId":640,"pinPosition":null,"submittedBy":{"id":640,"createdAt":"2025-03-11T18:06:16.724Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-30T15:40:55.799Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"cmeesters","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/b0badc81-644f-4814-8d96-2cab6124d60a/","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Meesters","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":null,"orcid":"0000-0003-2408-7588"},"module":{"id":1150,"createdAt":"2025-05-07T20:14:29.140Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-07T20:14:29.140Z","displayColor":"#574cfa","published":true,"publishedAt":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","publishedWhere":"Zenodo","originMetadata":"DataCite","url":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15360613","isbn":null,"prefix":"10.5281","suffix":"zenodo.15360613","title":"SLURM Executor Plugin - Support for GPUs","description":"As of v1.0.0 of the plugin, using GPUs is facilitated by the Snakemake Executor Plugin for SLURM","language":"en","licenseId":2,"moduleTypeId":23,"main":{},"supporting":{"files":[]},"authorsRaw":{"object":[{"name":"Meesters, Christian","nameType":"Personal","givenName":"Christian","familyName":"Meesters","affiliation":["Universität Mainz"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"nameIdentifier":"0000-0003-2408-7588","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]},{"name":"Topolsky, Ivan","nameType":"Personal","givenName":"Ivan","familyName":"Topolsky","affiliation":["D-BSSE - ETHZ/Basel"],"nameIdentifiers":[{"nameIdentifier":"0000-0002-7561-0810","nameIdentifierScheme":"ORCID"}]}]},"referencesRaw":[false]},"editor":{"id":70,"createdAt":"2025-04-30T15:21:58.590Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-30T15:21:58.590Z","role":"OWNER","isActive":true,"collectionId":55,"workspaceId":640,"workspace":{"id":640,"createdAt":"2025-03-11T18:06:16.724Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-30T15:40:55.799Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"cmeesters","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/b0badc81-644f-4814-8d96-2cab6124d60a/","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Meesters","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":null,"orcid":"0000-0003-2408-7588"}}}],"editors":[{"id":70,"createdAt":"2025-04-30T15:21:58.590Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-30T15:21:58.590Z","role":"OWNER","isActive":true,"collectionId":55,"workspaceId":640,"workspace":{"id":640,"createdAt":"2025-03-11T18:06:16.724Z","updatedAt":"2025-04-30T15:40:55.799Z","workspaceType":"Individual","handle":"cmeesters","avatar":"https://ucarecdn.com/b0badc81-644f-4814-8d96-2cab6124d60a/","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Meesters","name":null,"bio":null,"pronouns":null,"url":null,"orcid":"0000-0003-2408-7588","members":[{"id":632,"role":"OWNER","workspaceId":640,"userId":657,"invitedName":null,"invitedEmail":null,"emailInvitations":true,"emailApprovals":true,"emailWeeklyDigest":false,"emailCollections":true,"user":{"id":657}}]}}],"type":{"id":3,"createdAt":"2022-09-23T13:58:50.844Z","updatedAt":"2025-05-07T15:15:23.273Z","type":"COMMUNITY","price":14999,"price_id":"price_1LgCLQLmgtJbKHNGNoiEKuv1"}}

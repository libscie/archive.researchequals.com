# `archive.researchequals.com`

This repository contains all archival content and code for ResearchEquals. This repository falls under the current [immediate archival strategy.](https://libscie.org/researchequals-archival-strategy/). More details on the implementation are [available on our blog as well](https://libscie.org/p/186b8543-7ff1-48fc-8875-0a1d4f0ea5c1/).

The key points are:

1. Link structure is maintained from `researchequals.com/`
2. Nightly updates to the archive for completeness
3. In case of a disaster, all we need to do is switch `archive.researchequals.com` to `researchequals.com` and links + DOIs will keep working.
